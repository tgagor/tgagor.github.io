They are the core values that drive the behavior of leaders and, consequently, all employees in the organization.\nThey were built when the company was scaling rapidly and it was no longer possible to rely on the CEO as the sole source of values and direction. Other leaders had to adopt the same behaviors and set the same expectations to keep the company cohesive.\nLeadership Principles Let me quote the principles listed in the book, as they’re really good ones.\nCustomer Obsession\nLeaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.\nOwnership\nLeaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say, “that’s not my job.”\nInvent and Simplify\nLeaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.\nAre Right, A Lot\nLeaders are right a lot. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.\nLearn and Be Curious\nLeaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.\nHire and Develop the Best\nLeaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.\nInsist on the Highest Standards\nLeaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.\nThink Big\nThinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.\nBias for Action\nSpeed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking.\nFrugality\nAccomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.\nEarn Trust\nLeaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.\nDive Deep\nLeaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.\nHave Backbone; Disagree and Commit\nLeaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.\nDeliver Results\nLeaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.\nThere are actually two more principles listed on “Amazon Leadership Principles” external link website: “Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer” and “Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility”. As they were not in the book, I will ignore them but you can check more on the Amazon’s perspective on their website.\nMy rants I didn’t have high expectations for this book. I was expecting random advice from someone who was no longer with the company. Since the authors no longer work at Amazon, I was at least partially right 😄 I was also expecting some American-style glorification, and while there was a bit of that, I was surprised by the quality of the principles themselves. I really like them and could identify with many.\nThere are a lot of them, but they provide Amazon’s leadership with something few companies have: a roadmap for decision-making. They’re a bit like a bible - depending on the context, you can refer to them to support your decisions. They’re straightforward and simple. I haven’t finished the book yet, but I’m sure I’ll be revisiting these principles from time to time.\nThose values trigger another reference to the Amazon culture: the Vitality Curve external link as a performance management practice. I’m not sure if they still use it, but this wiki article describe quite well why it’s a bad system and I remember one quote from it too:\nRecruiters, though, also say that other businesses are sometimes cautious about bringing in Amazon workers, because they have been trained to be so combative. The derisive local nickname for Amazon employees is “Amholes”\nI’ve been working with such people, they’re not team players and sometimes it’s better to have “weaker” team, that collaborate, than one (or even worse: two) super hero who drives everything on it’s own and do not share.\n","wordCount":"906","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://gagor.pro/book/2024/working-backwards/images/book-cover.webp","datePublished":"2024-01-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-12-16T08:45:18+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tom"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gagor.pro/book/2024/working-backwards/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tom's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gagor.pro/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gagor.pro/ accesskey=h title="Tom's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gagor.pro/favicon-36x36.avif alt="Page logo" aria-label=logo height=36>Tom's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
