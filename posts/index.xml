      <title>My pre-commit config for Hugo blog</title>

      <description>I love blogging with Hugo and I have two blogs already that use it. The good thing about static sites is that you have all the data in the files. You can optimize them locally, batch process, amend, etc. Powerful templating engine allows to quickly pre fill documents in the format I like.
I have some steps in the Makefile for things like image optimization, but I often don&amp;rsquo;t remember to run them &amp;#x1f603;</description>

      <description>TL;DR If you&amp;rsquo;re not interested in the &amp;ldquo;story of my life&amp;rdquo;, go directly to &amp;ldquo;Tuning PipeWire&amp;rdquo; section.
I&amp;rsquo;m not an audiophile, but I spent whole days in the headphones and I like when sound sounds good. I like slight bass boost, which adds this kick to the melody, but won&amp;rsquo;t overwhelm me after an hour of listening. I like when high tones are clear, but I get annoyed if they&amp;rsquo;re too strong.</description>

      <description>I use Git a lot, even writing this article i will commit text few times. There&amp;rsquo;s a set of aliases I rely on daily and they&amp;rsquo;re first I add in new place.
Some Git commands are unnecessarily verbose. You can make your life much easier with bash-completions, but if you write it tens of times per day, it&amp;rsquo;s anyway a lot of typing&amp;hellip; and I&amp;rsquo;m a lazy man &amp;#x1f604;
Simple status/log checks git s s = status --short --branch --untracked-files Shows a short, branch-focused status with untracked files.</description>

      <title>Checking compressed size of Docker image</title>

      <description>One day, I was looking for some gains to improve the startup time for Jenkins agents. We run them as containers and because images are quite big, I was thinking about cutting the size, by cutting less frequently used features. I was looking for the metrics I could use to decide which changes are most valuable. I could think about two: download time and startup time. Together they combine to the gap between the request to start agent and the moment you can start to use it.</description>

      <description>A little bit of sour-sweet memories I&amp;rsquo;ve been in many job interviews. Few as a candidate but many more as a Technical Leader or Hiring Manager. There are many questions I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked and many tests I passed. I remember one test, where I had to install and configure Apache Tomcat on a Virtual Machine, under Windows (which I don&amp;rsquo;t use for years), without access to internet. There were more traps there, like some files in the locations where Tomcat is normally installed were blocked for write with chattr immutable attribute.</description>

      <description>Why? Hiring people is a hard, but having a new person in a team is not a work done. It&amp;rsquo;s important to monitor how people perform during probation period and share feedback with them. Personally, I like to ask the whole team, with a bunch of open questions, which allows me to look from higher altitude on the new hire. My point of view might be biased but checking what others think, I can fill blind spots.</description>

      <description>Nazbierało mi się w domu całkiem sporo różnych roślin. Problem w tym, że nie zawsze pamiętam jak należy je pielęgnować. Rzeczy typu częstotliwość podlewania, wymagane nasłonecznienie, rodzaj nawozu, częstotliwość używania nawozu, itd., itp.
Postanowiłem to w końcu spisać. Na razie na jednej stronie i trochę na kolanie, by pokonać opór. Zamierzam to nieco uszczegółowić i wypracować jakiś schemat podlewania/nawożenia. Myślałem też o jakiś zabawkach do mierzenia poziomu wilgotności/PH - zobaczymy.</description>

      <description>Info
I use free tier of Cloudflare and all recommendations assume only those are available.
Why to cache statically generated blog? My Blog is statically generated website served from Github Pages. As Github don&amp;rsquo;t allow to easily set my own domain (at least in free version), I needed some kind of proxy that:
can server page from my domain, will provide valid certificate for HTTPS. Info
I know HTTPS for static site is a non-sense, but to keep it performant with HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 - you need it.</description>

      <description>Almost 2 years ago I was promoted to a Team Lead position. Since then at least half of my time is dedidcated to &amp;ldquo;the people&amp;rsquo;s stuff&amp;rdquo; &amp;#x1f604;
On one side, I have less time to code and write about technical stuff, which sometimes makes me feel guilty (just a little bit). On the other side, I&amp;rsquo;m discovering a whole new world of possibilities to solve technical problems without touching the code (almost).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of Getting Things Done1 methodology and I recommend to read the book of the same title to anyone. I know, it looks like a typical, american corpo bull****, but it&amp;rsquo;s not! Wheter you&amp;rsquo;re a busy manager or a father of three - it might help you to manage things you have to do, on time and with less stress.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying multiple apps to support this methodology, but eventually I stick to Google Tasks app 2.</description>

      <description>Zwift runs by default in windowed mode, with ugly start menu at bottom and title bar. It&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal, just something irritating. It might be as silly as funny, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find a good answer for it. There are instructions but, where the heck is &amp;ldquo;Settings&amp;rdquo; button? &amp;#x1f604;
Eventually, accidentaly I found it! So let me share, with pictures &amp;#x1f60e;
Find in top-right corner icon with your points and click it From menu, choose &amp;ldquo;My settings&amp;rdquo; In new window, choose &amp;ldquo;Sound &amp;amp; Display&amp;rdquo; tab There it is!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about switching comments system to something different on my blog. Since I moved to Hugo, I used Disqus. Integration was easy and it was also easy to move comments from Wordpress. Maybe the move was easy, but people somehow didn&amp;rsquo;t like the interface. I receive 6 comments since I switched from Wordpress 3 years ago &amp;#x1f604; To be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t like it too.
I was thinking about switch to something else, something different, but I was waiting for this punch.</description>

      <description>Today, I was trying to pull/push repos from Github and I was getting timeout errors. I use SSH for clonning and I prefer it this way over HTTPS.
I was looking for the reason but it felt like a temporary glitch, either on Github&amp;rsquo;s or my provider&amp;rsquo;s side. I was googling for anything, that could help me and I found1 the way to use Github ssh clone/push/pull via SSH (as I want), but via port 443&amp;hellip; Simulating HTTPS traffic&amp;hellip; OK&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>TL;DR While reasoning is important, readers may not be interested in all the frustrations I experienced while figuring out how to get things done. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a quick solution, skip to the &amp;ldquo;What eventually worked?&amp;rdquo; section. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the thought process behind the solution, keep reading.
Why? Some might bother why the hell I&amp;rsquo;d like to make my life so hard? &amp;#x1f923;

      <description>I switched recently from Docker Desktop on my MacBook to Rancher Desktop. The most important reason for me to do it, was possibility to gently switch between docker and containerd runtimes.
There&amp;rsquo;s still one feature that I miss on Rancher Desktop - possibility to change Docker daemon configuration. I used to enable experimental features1 and BuildKit2. Sadly, there&amp;rsquo;s no easy way to do it on Rancher&amp;hellip; But there&amp;rsquo;s a magical way3.</description>

      <title>Best practices for writing Dockerfiles - Use VOLUME for all mutable, temporary file locations</title>
      <link>https://gagor.pl/2022/09/best-practices-for-writing-dockerfiles-use-volume-for-all-mutable-temporary-file-locations/</link>

      <description>IMO people don&amp;rsquo;t understand how VOLUME1 works so they don&amp;rsquo;t use it. It&amp;rsquo;s generally used far too rarely!
In short VOLUME means two things:
Whatever is left in directory marked as VOLUME, stays there and can&amp;rsquo;t be changed in later layers (actually it can be changed but changes won&amp;rsquo;t be persistent). Volumes are not part of layered image FS. They&amp;rsquo;re mounted as anonymous volumes located on standard file system. This means they&amp;rsquo;re working much faster.</description>

      <description>People often complain, that building Docker image takes a long time. &amp;ldquo;I just added a single jar package&amp;rdquo; they say&amp;hellip; Really?
They often don&amp;rsquo;t remember that whole &amp;ldquo;build context&amp;rdquo;1 is uploaded to Docker daemon during build, which often means they&amp;rsquo;re not only adding &amp;ldquo;single jar&amp;rdquo;, but also all sources, test results and whatever they have in working directory.
Solution is simple - to use .dockerignore file2. Syntax is similar to .</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking for a long time about writing set of articles on the topic of: &amp;ldquo;Dockerfile writing best practices&amp;rdquo;.
As it&amp;rsquo;s often my daily job to prepare best in class containers, that are later used by thousands of company&amp;rsquo;s applications, I have quite good insights on the topic. Some experience and knowledge gathered is often against intuition and building it took me a while. I want to share it, with a hope that feedback I get will allow me to excel on the topic even further.</description>

      <description>What I want to do? I use my pool to securely store backups, archive my old documents and keep huge family&amp;rsquo;s photo library.
I have new disks. They were tortured with badblocks, so they&amp;rsquo;re ready to create ZFS pool.
I&amp;rsquo;ve read few documents about different approaches 1 2 3. I wanted to be sure if anything changed during past years. One of articles recommends mirroring over RAIDZ. Resilvering is faster, at the same time putting IO less stress on whole pool.</description>

      <description>I used to have RAID (or at least some variation of it) for my main storage. For redundancy, in case of disk failure. I started with some crazy LVM mirrors done on two disks of different size. Sync job was starting on every boot &amp;#x1f604;
Then came time for RAID5 on mdadm + LVM for volume management. It was working nice until the moment when disks became bigger. Long array rebuilds or checks, required my PC to stay turned on overnight just to validate if stuff works still.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how it is in your company, but in mine it&amp;rsquo;s considered a good practice to add ticket numbers to commit messages. It allows to easily determine why something was changed, etc. Makes sense, but this also means, that I should be adding this ticket to every message&amp;hellip; And this doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense for me. I will accidentally avoid it from time to time or make a lot of typos.</description>

      <description>I use brew extensively on MacOS. It&amp;rsquo;s just as convenient as many Linux package managers. What I don&amp;rsquo;t like, it leaves dependencies after removal of formula. There&amp;rsquo;s simple way to clean it up by running one command 1.
Uninstall with dependencies brew uninstall FORMULA brew autoremove Info
In my case running brew autoremove actually removed few packages I really wanted to have. Check the output carefully!

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve build new PC - it&amp;rsquo;s based on Asus ROG STRIX Z590-E GAMING WIFI motherboard. Generally, I&amp;rsquo;m quite satisfied, but it have one irritating downside - after each UEFI BIOS upgrade, it&amp;rsquo;s silently resetting some of settings.
Let me note, what I want to have there:

I found new place accidentally, reading some news about CentOS Stream 9 on their blog. There was reference to CentOS 9 Stream dev builds of Docker images and I found &amp;ldquo;missing&amp;rdquo; stream and stream8 tags too.</description>

      <description>I wanted to share publicly some photos, but I performed them with navigation enabled so they contained accurate localisation of my house. I wanted to remove EXIF data GPS tags, my phone type and other irrelevant stuff.
TL;DR You will need imagemagick installed (use apt/yum/dnf of whatever you have there):
Install imagemagick sudo apt install -y imagemagick To remove them just use: Strip EXIF data mogrify -strip image.jpg How to check if it&amp;rsquo;s working?</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes useful to quickly connect to JMX console, to checkout what&amp;rsquo;s going on in your application, but the whole thing get&amp;rsquo;s tricky if you&amp;rsquo;re running your app in a container. I need it from time to time and I keep myself few times searching for set of params below:

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re all divided with recent decision to focus on CentOS Stream, which essentially means that stable, professional distro will turn into rolling release now. Also CentOS board members don&amp;rsquo;t gave us more confidence for the future.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be totally sceptic, I would like to test it on my own and only then, decide if it&amp;rsquo;s stable enough. But I work mostly with Docker containers and there are no official Docker images with Stream variant.</description>

      <description>TL;DR
CentOS base images sucks! They&amp;rsquo;re old, not updated for months!
As a professional DevOps I concern about a lot of things&amp;hellip; but security is always close to the top of the list. With Docker build environments and deployments became much more stable, which often is a result of just being stale ;/
I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about this for long time but it&amp;rsquo;s still hard for people to believe it.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Wordpress as an engine of my blog for past 8~9 years. I have small VPS with PHP + Nginx and you can find a lot of configuration examples from my config on this site &amp;#x1f604;
There was a time, when I was really satisfied by what it provides.</description>

      <title>Moving from Linux to MacOS – first steps</title>
      <link>https://gagor.pl/2020/01/moving-from-linux-to-macos-first-steps/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://gagor.pl/2020/01/moving-from-linux-to-macos-first-steps/</guid>
      <description>Few years ago I moved from Linux desktop to MacOS for my business, day to day work. There were 2 main reasons for that:
Corporations don&amp;rsquo;t like Linux - they can&amp;rsquo;t manage it, they can&amp;rsquo;t support it, so they blocked it with &amp;ldquo;Security policy&amp;rdquo;, ISO20001, or other nonsense. Actually they&amp;rsquo;re partially right but in different place - many business collaboration applications don&amp;rsquo;t work well on LInux (or they don&amp;rsquo;t work at all) Skype for Business - there&amp;rsquo;s open source alternative but to get full support you have to pay for additional codecs (as far as I remember) - it&amp;rsquo;s not working stable even in paid version Outlook and calendar support - I love Thunderbird and I use it for years, but calendar invitations didn&amp;rsquo;t work nice (honestly, they didn&amp;rsquo;t work nice even between different Outlook versions&amp;hellip;) Corporate VPN apps - Christ, I always was able to get it working eventually, but&amp;hellip; why bother I&amp;rsquo;m older, maybe lazier, maybe smarter - I don&amp;rsquo;t like to spend my time resolving problems that don&amp;rsquo;t give me any value.</description>

Debug GET commands tcpflow -c dst port 11211 | cut -b46- | grep ^get cut command will remove 46 bytes at beginning of every string (src, dst, port). You may need to adjust numeric parameter for cut to leave commands only.</description>

Sometimes it was because of bad ssh keys configuration, other times file permissions, mostly such stuff.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using standard MySQL dumps as backup technique on my VPS for few years. It works fine and backups were usable few times when I needed them. But in other places I&amp;rsquo;m using xtrabackup. It&amp;rsquo;s faster when crating backups and a lot faster when restoring them - they&amp;rsquo;re binary so there is no need to reevaluate all SQL create tables/inserts/etc. Backups also include my.cnf config file so restoring on other machine should be easy.</description>

      <description>When you deploy your application in cloud you don&amp;rsquo;t need and don&amp;rsquo;t want your hosts exposed via SSH to the world. Malware scans whole network for easy SSH access and when find something will try some brute force attacks, overloading such machines. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to have one exposed, but secured host, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t host anything and is used as proxy/gateway to access our infrastructure- it&amp;rsquo;s called bastion host.
Ansible is quite easy to integrate with bastion host configuration.</description>

For APT you may use this trick to force IPv4 connections only:
echo &amp;#39;Acquire::ForceIPv4 &amp;#34;true&amp;#34;;&amp;#39; &amp;gt; /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99force-ipv4 If you need more than that, then gai.conf will allow you to filter where you will be connecting via IPv4 and where via IPv6 - in example bellow you will prefer IPv4 whenever it&amp;rsquo;s available:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m playing a lot with Docker lately. Building images, and then rebuilding, and then building again&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s pretty boring. To automate this task a little I used inotify to build automatically after I changed any file. This trick could be used in many different situations.
You will need inotify-tools package:
sudo apt-get install -y inotify-tools Then run something like this:
while inotifywait -e modify -r .; do docker-compose build; done This commands will rebuild my Docker images after any file change in current directory.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Make backup - it&amp;rsquo;s not required but strongly advised &amp;#x1f603;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I watched nice presentation about how Cloudflare protects itself against DoS. Most of us are not able to do that exactly like them but some of tips were general enough to be used on typical web front server.
I took notes from this presentation and presented here. Thanks to Marek agreement I also reposted all examples (in easier to copy paste way).

      <description>I was looking at backup task running on my desk and saw that it&amp;rsquo;s spending a lot of time on ~/.local/share/zeitgeist directory. I checked and it had 4.6GB:
du -sh ~/.local/share/zeitgeist/* 118M activity.sqlite 44M activity.sqlite.bck 32K activity.sqlite-shm 4,4G activity.sqlite-wal 311M fts.index WTF? Fortunately I found here that I could easily delete some of this:
zeitgeist-daemon --quit Now check that it&amp;rsquo;s not running:
ps axu | grep zeitgeist-daemon timor 9105 0.0 0.</description>

      <description>There are many possible real life cases and not all optimization technics will be suitable for you but I hope it will be a good starting place.
Also you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t copy paste examples with faith that they will make your server fly &amp;#x1f603; You have to support your decisions with excessive tests and help of monitoring system (ex. Grafana).
Cache static and dynamic content Setting caching static and dynamic content strategy may offload your server from additional load from repetitive downloads of same, rarely updated files.</description>

#!/bin/bash function die { echo $1; exit 1; } if [[ $# -eq 0 ]] ; then die &amp;#34;Give hostname and time in minutes as parameter!&amp;#34; fi if [[ $# -eq 1 ]] ; then MINUTES=15 else MINUTES=$2 fi HOST=$1 NAGURL=http://nagios.</description>

First configure repo with current Grafana version (select your distro):
curl https://packagecloud.io/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add - deb https://packagecloud.io/grafana/testing/debian/ wheezy main Now install package (on wheezy I needed to install apt-transport-https to allow installation of packages from repo via HTTPS):
apt-get update apt-get install -y apt-transport-https apt-get install -y grafana By default Grafana will use sqlite database to keep information about users, etc:</description>

Installation of collectd is easy on Debian because packages are in default repo. One problem is that packages may be old, ex. on wheezy it version 5.1. But in backports/backports-sloppy you may find current 5.</description>

      <description>From the first moment I heard about Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt I liked it and wanted to use it as fast as possible. But the more I read how they want to implement it, the more I dislike it.
Current project with automatic configuration is not what I want to use at all. I have many very complicated configs and I do not trust such tools enough to use them. I like UNIX&amp;rsquo;s single purpose principle, tools should do one thing and do it well - nothing more.</description>

      <description>Lately I had a lot of brute force attacks on my WordPress blog. I used basic auth to /wp-admin part in nginx configuration to block this and as a better solution I wan&amp;rsquo;t to block source IPs at all on firewall.
To do this, place this filter code in /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/wp-login.conf:
# WordPress brute force wp-login.php filter: # # Block IPs trying to authenticate in WordPress blog # # Matches e.g. # 178.</description>

shutdown db service mysql stop create text file with command like this (update user accordingly) ex. in /tmp/pwchange.txt SET PASSWORD FOR &amp;#34;root&amp;#34;@&amp;#34;localhost&amp;#34; = PASSWORD(&amp;#34;HereYourNewPassword&amp;#34;); start mysqld with --init-file param mysqld_safe --init-file=/tmp/pwchange.</description>

sfdisk -d /dev/sda | sfdisk /dev/sdb but it&amp;rsquo;s not working any more on GPT partition tables. Hopefully it still can be done but with different toolstack &amp;#x1f604;
Install gdisk:
apt-get install -y gdisk Then use sgdisk like this:
sgdisk -R /dev/sd_dest /dev/sd_src sgdisk -G /dev/sd_dest First command will copy partition from /dev/sd_src to /dev/sd_dest.</description>

We have few options to do this.
Reset admin password We have to connect to database and use this SQL:
UPDATE `user` SET user_password = CONCAT( SUBSTRING(user_password, 1, 3), SUBSTRING(MD5(user_name), 1, 8), &amp;#39;:&amp;#39;, MD5(CONCAT(SUBSTRING(MD5(user_name), 1, 8), &amp;#39;-&amp;#39;, MD5(&amp;#39;new password&amp;#39;)))) WHERE user_name = &amp;#39;Admin&amp;#39;; Just replace Admin with your username and new password with your password.</description>

      <description>I need to check memory usage of memcached server so I used:
echo stats | nc 127.0.0.1 11211 STAT pid 2743 STAT uptime 263 STAT time 1395438951 STAT version 1.4.13 STAT pointer_size 64 STAT rusage_user 0.482926 STAT rusage_system 2.675593 STAT curr_items 8667 STAT total_items 10742 STAT bytes 23802513 STAT curr_connections 296 STAT total_connections 399 STAT connection_structures 297 STAT cmd_flush 0 STAT cmd_get 52578 STAT cmd_set 10792 STAT get_hits 28692 STAT get_misses 23886 STAT evictions 0 STAT bytes_read 35984361 STAT bytes_written 192647437 STAT limit_maxbytes 536870912 STAT threads 2 STAT accepting_conns 1 STAT listen_disabled_num 0 STAT replication MASTER STAT repcached_qi_free 8189 STAT repcached_wdata 0 STAT repcached_wsize 1026048 END For me, bytes value was important but you could find more about all statistics here.</description>

      <description>I have development server with postfix - I wanted to allow outbound traffic to one domain but cut off all the rest. I definitely do not want that test mail or any debug info goes to service users.
I have to add something like that to /etc/postfix/transport:
allowed.domain.com : * discard: Then run:
postmap /etc/postfix/transport At end, add these to /etc/postfix/main.cf:
transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport Reload postfix:
postfix reload Test if it works:</description>

      <description>In recent Ansible update to 1.5 version there is really nice feature ssh pipelining. This option is serious alternative to accelerated mode.
Just add to you config file (ex. ~/.ansible.cfg):
[ssh_connection] pipelining=True Now run any playbook - you will see the difference &amp;#x1f604;

      <description>To najlepszy przepis na chrusty jaki znam - wychodzą bardzo kruche i delikatne.
Składniki 4 zółtka, 4 łyżki wina białego lub czerwonego, 4 łyżki mąki. Sposób przygotowania Wszystkie składniki wymieszać i wyrobić. Ciasto powinno być mniej wiecej takie jak na pierogi. Bić pałką/wałkiem, składać na pół i tak kilka razy przez ok 5 minut. Potem ciasto rozwałkować bardzo cieniutko i wykrawać chrusty, małe bo mocno rosną. Następnie wrzucać na rozgrzany olej/smalec.</description>

      <description>I had quite simple task - compare two lists of hosts and check if hosts from first one are also on the second one. I started with diff:
diff -u biglist.txt hosts_to_check.txt | grep -E &amp;#34;^\+&amp;#34; It was fine but output needs some filtering to get what I want.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found another example with grep:
grep -Fxv -f biglist.txt hosts_to_check.txt | sort -n This will search for all lines in hosts_to_check.</description>

      <description>After WSUS installing on Windows Server 2012 I discovered that it&amp;rsquo;s running on port 8530, different than on older version of Windows (it was using port 80 from beginning). But what&amp;rsquo;s more interesting it was running ONLY on IPv6 interface! Switching binding configuration in IIS doesn&amp;rsquo;t help.
I could stand switching port - it&amp;rsquo;s nothing hard with GPO, but IPv6 only configuration was not acceptable.
After googling for some time I found one command that solved my problems by switching WSUS to older behavior and run it on port 80 (on default website).</description>

      <description>After reading some good opinions about MariaDB I wanted to give it a try. Upgrade looks quite straight forward but I found some issues a little tricky.
Installation Add repo and key:
cat &amp;gt; /etc/apt/sources.list &amp;lt;&amp;lt;SRC deb http://mirrors.supportex.net/mariadb/repo/5.5/debian wheezy main deb-src http://mirrors.supportex.net/mariadb/repo/5.5/debian wheezy main SRC (find more repositories here)
Now install MariaDB:
sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install mariadb-server It could be better to install mariadb-server-5.5 and mariadb-client-5.5 package instead, because of this error.</description>

      <description>I was thinking about allowing access to my website using SPDY protocol for better performance and security (and for fun of course &amp;#x1f603; ). But SPDY have one disadvantage - you need SSL certificate signed by known authority that will verfiy in common browsers. So you can&amp;rsquo;t use self signed certificates because everyone will see a warning entering your site. Certs are quite expensive so I started searching for free one and to my surprise I found such!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using different code editors for different purposes. Gedit was fine for small scripts but not for bigger projects. It lacks intelligent code completion (function/class names, etc.). I was searching for convenient editor for Python, Perl, Ruby with support for frameworks like Django, Rails, etc. I know Sublime Text - but it&amp;rsquo;s paid. There is LimeText - open source clone, but it&amp;rsquo;s not ready to be used on daily basics.</description>

The bad thing was that they can&amp;rsquo;t properly report to WSUS and get updates from it.
I found that there are two updates that have to be installed (but they&amp;rsquo;re not working without additional steps):

      <description>I love Shotwell for it&amp;rsquo;s simplicity and easy export to Piwigo. After Christmas I added new photos to my library but after that I made some modifications to them (red eye reduction, etc&amp;hellip;). Because Shotwell generate thumbnails only on import, all my modifications were not visible on preview.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started searching how to regenerate thumbs and found this info. There were two issues with this method:
this howto was for old version (with old paths) and only for 128px thumbs I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t want to regenerate thumbnails for 40k photos!</description>

      <description>Some time ago I&amp;rsquo;ve show how to precompress js and css file with gzip to be available for Nginx&amp;rsquo;s mod_gzip. In default configuration Apache don&amp;rsquo;t have such module but similar functionality could be achieved with few custom rewirtes.
Basically we will start with these rewrites to serve gzipped CSS/JS files if they exist and the client accepts gzip compression:
RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-encoding} gzip RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.gz -s RewriteRule ^(.*)\.(js|css)$ $1\.$2\.gz [QSA] Then we need to setup proper content types for such compressed files - I know how to do this in two ways:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy owner of Galaxy Nexus 7 and lately I updated my tablet to Android 4.4 Kitkat. One of features I most expected was ability to block some permissions of some applications. Such setting was available in 4.4 version but was removed in latest 4.4.2 - Google didn&amp;rsquo;t explain it exactly why. I don&amp;rsquo;t like when for ex. game need: camera or GPS access - for what I asked?
But there is new app so called App Ops that unhides build-in interface allowing edit of application permissions.</description>

Firstly find your favorite curve. A short tip about bit length and complexity could be found here. From it you will now that using 256 bit ECDSA key should be enough for next 10-20 years.</description>

Firstly I have to identify streams in file:
$ mkvmerge -i input_file.mkv File &amp;#39;test.mkv&amp;#39;: container: Matroska Track ID 0: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC) Track ID 1: audio (A_DTS) Track ID 2: audio (A_AC3) Track ID 3: audio (A_DTS) Track ID 4: audio (A_AC3) Track ID 5: subtitles (S_TEXT/UTF8) Track ID 6: subtitles (S_TEXT/UTF8) Chapters: 16 entries You could use more verbose tool mkvinfo for that purpose too.</description>

Below are commands used by me for that conversion:

      <description>SPDY is new protocol proposed by Google as an alternative for HTTP(S). Currently Chrome and Firefox browsers are using it as default if available on server. It is faster in most cases by few to several percent. The side effect of using mod_spdy is that it&amp;rsquo;s working well only with thread safe Apache&amp;rsquo;s modules. PHP module for Apache is not thread safe so we need to use PHP as CGI or FastCGI service.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s quite rare to have problems with XFS and inodes exhaustion. Mostly because XFS doesn&amp;rsquo;t have inode limit in a manner known from other filesystems - it&amp;rsquo;s using some percentage of whole filesystem as a limit and in most distributions it&amp;rsquo;s 25%. So it&amp;rsquo;s really huge amount of inodes. But some tools and distributions lowered limit ex. 5% or 10% and there you could have problems more often.
You could check what is you limit by issuing xfs_info with drive and searching for imaxpct value:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just bought new toy - Iomega StorCenter ix2-200 Cloud Edition. I have to play with few options before I could start using it. First thing - Firmware upgrade.
Firmware upgrade I&amp;rsquo;ve started searching for latest firmware for ix2-200 Cloud and found that I have to register on Lenovo site to get firmware&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t like such sites where they force me to give all private data, but after few clicks on &amp;ldquo;Recommended articles&amp;rdquo; on that site I landed here:</description>

      <description>After some configuration changes I&amp;rsquo;ve stuck with VBP not listening nor on HTTP, nor on SSH port. Last resort was to use CLI to reenable HTTP access. Connect with parameters:
Baud rate: 9600 Parity: none Bits: 8 Stopbits: 1 Flow control: none Then in login prompt you have to use login credentials (yes - they&amp;rsquo;re the same on every box (WTF?)):
User: - root Pass: - @#$%^&amp;amp;*!() Password is shift + 2345678190 - there is 1 before 9!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve crated this blog to get feedback from other IT guys about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing wrong (or not good enough). But this idea failed&amp;hellip;
I have only few comments on my blog (and about thousand and a half spams per month) - so, no feedback in my national language at all.
Switching to English should make my audience bigger and I hope to have more attention thanks to that. This will be also a good practice of my English skill.</description>

      <description>Niedawno zainteresowałem się usługą Gearman i jedynej rzeczy której mi brakowało to jakiegoś łatwego mechanizmu zarządzającego workerami. Ale jak zwykle okazało się że inni mieli już ten problem i odpowiednie narzędzie istnieje - mowa o GearmanManagerze.
Instalacja GearmanManagera Aby zainstalować GeramanManagera na serwerze gdzie już mamy Gearmana trzeba wykonać kilka kroków (wcześniej powinniśmy też zainstalować moduł gearmana do php&amp;rsquo;a):
apt-get install git -y git clone https://github.com/brianlmoon/GearmanManager.git cd GearmanManager/install chmod +x install.</description>

      <title>Debian - zablokowanie aktualizacji pakietu</title>

      <description>W teorii nie powinno się blokować aktualizacji pakietów bo łatają dziury itd&amp;hellip;. Ale! Zdarzyły mi się ostatnio dwie sytuacje, które do tego mnie zmusiły:
aktualizacja hudsona kończyła się błędem przy starcie usługi, aktualizacja domU Xen skończyła się problemem z kompatybilnością mechanizmu udev w systemie i jądrze (hypervisor miał starsze jądro niż spodziewało się DomU). W takich sytuacjach bardzo przydaje się możliwość zablokowania aktualizacji jednej &amp;ldquo;psującej&amp;rdquo; paczki na pewien okres czasu by nie opóźniać innych aktualizacji a sobie dać czas na rozpracowanie problemu.</description>

      <description>Ostatnio trafiłem na ciekawą usługę, która pozwala oddelegować długo trwające zadania z usługi webowej. Mowa o Gearman&amp;rsquo;ie. Usługa jest o tyle ciekawa że nie narzuca ani języka dla klienta (większość popularnych ma gotowe biblioteki), ani język dla skryptów w tej usłudze nie jest narzucany. Można tę usługę wykorzystać jako most pomiędzy PHP a np. Javą/Pythonem lub do zlecenia zadań z serwera na Linux&amp;rsquo;ie do wykonania na serwerze Windowsowym (bo np. narzędzia dostępne są tylko dla Windowsa).</description>

      <description>Kolejna zabawna sytuacja - pewna aplikacja dotNET&amp;rsquo;owa działała dziwnie na 64-bitowym systemie, a tymczasem na 32-bitowej maszynie ta sama aplikacja działała bez problemów. Jedyna różnica to inne wersje klientów ODBC na tych systemach, które po kilku testach okazały się być przyczyną całego zła.
Pojawił się pomysł by odpalić aplikacje na 64 bitowym systemie ale w trybie 32 bit - poniżej krótkie HOWTO jak to osiągnąć:
potrzebujemy narzędzia corflags.exe które pozwoli oznaczyć nam binarkę jako 32-bitową, do pobrania tutaj a instrukcja jej użycia tutaj.</description>

      <description>Od jakiegoś czasu można kupić w NetArcie certyfikaty SSL, a niedawno zrobili na nie promocję - 15zł za pierwszy rok (za certyfikat na jedną stronkę). Tzw. tanie i dobre. Po wyrobieniu certyfikatu i zapisaniu z panelu klienta mam pliczki: stonka.crt i netart_rootca.crt, które wrzucamy do Apachego, powiedzmy tak:
SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/stonka.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/priv.key SSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/netart_rootca.crt Certyfikat działa w Chromie ale nie weryfikuje się w Firefoxie i Internet Explorerze. FF wyświetla błąd: sec_error_unknown_issuer - co oznacza brak certyfikatu wystawcy gdzieś w łańcuchu certyfikatów.</description>

      <description>Trafił mi się ostatnio ciekawy problem - otóż standardowo przed końcem roku poprawiałem filtry antyspamowe i optymalizowałem konfigurację Postfix&amp;rsquo;a. Chciałem zmienić domyślną wartość smtpd_delay_reject=yes na smtpd_delay_reject=no by odrzucać spamerów najwcześniej jak to możliwe. I ciekawe kuku, które sobie zrobiłem polegało na tym że sam nie mogłem wysyłać poczty po logowaniu SSL&amp;rsquo;em&amp;hellip;
Dostawałem przy tym bardzo wymowną odpowiedź:

      <description>Pomimo że Python dużo częściej wykorzystywany jest w środowiskach UNIX&amp;rsquo;owcy/Linux&amp;rsquo;owych to znajdzie się kilka fajnych zastosowań dla tego języka na Windowsie. Możliwości na instalację jest kilka, a najprostsza to wykorzystanie instalatora ActiveState. Wersja ta ma w sobie wszystko co potrzebne:
rozszerzenia dla API Windows menadżera pakietów PyPM dokumentację Niestety jakiś czas temu zmieniły się zasady licencjonowania w ActiveState i aktualne wersje dla zastosowań produkcyjnych wymagają zakupu licencji (1000$/rok - aż chce się zacytować z Dnia Świra: czizys k&amp;hellip;wa&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>Wyprzeć się nie mogę że gadżety działające na Linuksie po prostu mnie kręcą, więc tylko kwestią czasu było aż Pi zawita na moim biurku. Zakupiłem więc model B w drugiej wersji, obudowę z możliwością mocowania VESA, kabelek HDMI, ładowarka z mojej myszy pasowała idealnie (5.05V i 1A) i na początek karta SD klasa 10 4GB.
Szukając różnych systemów (a może ROM&amp;rsquo;ów) natrafiłem na oficjalną stronę: http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads
Na początek wystarczy a sprawdzając na stronach projektów okazało się że wersje na tej stronie są całkiem aktualne.</description>

Słowo wstępu Niektóre rewrite&amp;rsquo;y kończą się znakiem ? - czemu?
Otóż Nginx próbuje automatycznie dodawać parametry na końcu przepisanego adresu. Jeśli jednak wykorzystamy zmienną $request_uri to ona sama w sobie zawiera już parametry zapytania (czyli to co w URI znajduje się po znaku ?</description>

Ostatnio ustawiałem DFS&amp;rsquo;a z replikacją dla dwóch sporych zasobów i jedna z rzeczy, o którą się rozbiłem to brak jakiegokolwiek podglądu tej synchronizacji z GUI. Ale znalazłem jedno polecenie, które działa w shellu (choć to się chyba batch tutaj nazywa) od Windows Server 2008 R2:
dfsrdiag ReplicationState /member:nazwaservera Polecenie co prawda nie podaje postępu procentowego ale można zobaczyć &amp;ldquo;czy coś jeszcze się synchronizuje&amp;rdquo; i czy nie ma żadnych błędów.</description>

Dawno temu zrobiłem sobie skrypty do backupu - jeden kompresuje wolumeny LVM - a drugi pozwala odtworzyć z dekompresja na drugim serwerze. Tyle że przy tak dużej maszynce będzie to trwało masakrycznie długo - fajnie byłoby móc równocześnie kopiować i odtwarzać (live)&amp;hellip;
I wtedy przypomniało mi się narzędzie netcat - zrobiłem snapshoty wolumenów i mogłem zaczynać.</description>

      <guid>https://gagor.pl/2013/07/logrotate-kompresja-logow-xz/</guid>
      <description>Narzędzia xz-utils dostępne w nowszych systemach korzystają z mocniejszych algorytmów kompresji (jakaś odmiana LZMA, coś w stylu 7zip&amp;rsquo;a) przy zachowaniu kompatybilności składni poleceń z gzip&amp;rsquo;em/bzip&amp;rsquo;em - da się je zatem łatwo zintegrować w obecnych systemach. Ja chciałem wykorzystać xz do kompresji logów, które bywają przydatne ale przez większość czasy tylko zajmują miejsce :simple_smile:
W /etc/logrotate.conf dopisujemy:
compresscmd /usr/bin/xz uncompresscmd /usr/bin/unxz compressext .xz compressoptions -9T2 compressoptions można nie ustawiać bo domyślnie ma wartość -9 (czyli kompresuj na maxa), mój dodatek (czyli -T2) użyje dwóch wątków procesora gdy już ten mechanizm zostanie zimplementowany (bo na razie nie jest) :simple_smile:</description>

Pomijając że np. na tablecie 6-cio kanały DTS jest mi &amp;ldquo;niezbędny inaczej&amp;rdquo; to konwertując go do AAC stereo plik jest po prostu sporo mniejszy. Oczywiście nie zamierzam transkodować ścieżki video i na moje potrzeby mogłem sobie odpuścić zmianę częstotliwości próbkowania.
Najprościej wykorzystać pakiet ffmpeg (po nowemu avconv) lub mencoder (choć ten miewał niegdyś problem z poprawnym zapisywaniem wynikowych plików mkv, więc potrzebny jest dodatkowo mkvmerge z pakietu mkvtoolnix).</description>

By to zrobić są dwie możliwości:
Ręczne wydanie poleceń odkrywających volumeny (na jajkach od 2.6.x) Sprawdzamy jakie mamy karty:
ls /sys/class/fc_host/ (wypisze się coś w stylu: host1, host2)
Wydajemy do wybranej przez nas karty żądanie wykonania LIP (to się chyba tłumaczy jako loopback initialization) co skutkuje przeskanowaniem szyny FC:</description>

      <description>Miałem ostatnio zabawną sytuację gdy kilka serwerów z zainstalowanym NTPD miało rozjazdy rzędu kilkunastu sekund. Wyszło na to że moje serwery synchronizowały się z różnymi zewnętrznymi serwerami NTP pomiędzy, którymi były rozjazdy i te rozjazdy synchronizowały się na moich serwerach. Jeden &amp;ldquo;z moich&amp;rdquo; ustanowiłem głównym a wszystkie inne przekierowałem na niego (komentując wszystkie inne serwery NTP w konfiguracji). Wymusiłem synchronizację:

      <description>Do niedawna na moim telefonie VPN&amp;rsquo;ami były: PPTP lub L2TP - oba niespecjalnie mi się podobały. Ale od wersji 4-tej pojawiły się dwa nowe tryby: IPSec Xauth PSK i IPSec Xauth RSA. W pierwszym autoryzacja wykorzystuje login i hasło, w drugim certyfikaty.
Tryb IPSec Xauth PSK jest bardzo wygodny bo łatwo można połączyć go z zewnętrznymi mechanizmami uwierzytelniającymi np. LDAP, Active Directory, itp.
Pokażę jak skonfigurować swojego Fortigate&amp;rsquo;a by umożliwić połączenie z telefonów i tabletów na Androidzie 4.</description>

server_tokens off; more_set_headers &amp;#39;Server: BadAss&amp;#39;; And it&amp;rsquo;s good to setup non standard error pages on every site (500 and 404 at minimum):

      <guid>https://gagor.pl/2013/01/php-max_input_vars/</guid>
      <description>W PHP 5.3 pojawiła się nowa zmienna: max_input_vars, która limituje ilość pól możliwych do przesłania przez formularz, obcinając nadmiarowe. Pozwala to zapobiec atakom DoS na tablice hashujące (przynajmniej w tym jednym miejscu). Domyślna wartość tej zmiennej to 1000 i kreatywnym programistom udaje się tą wartość bez problemu osiągnąć &amp;#x1f603;
Warte odnotowania jest to że mając suhosin&amp;rsquo;a trzeba pamiętać o jeszcze dwóch innych zmiennych:
max_input_vars = 3000 suhosin.post.max_vars = 3000 suhosin.request.max_vars = 3000 Zmienne można zmienić od razu w /etc/php5/apache2/php.</description>

      <description>Dyski się zużywają i w końcu wcześniej czy później pojawiają się na nich bad sectory. Jeden z moich dysków ciut się posypał a że służy wyłącznie do backupów to mogę z tym żyć. Ale z drugiej strony jeżeli już będę musiał sięgnąć do backupów to chcę mieć pewność że coś odzyskam, dlatego postanowiłem zrobić kilka testów. Nawet jeśli nie naprawi to sektorów to przynajmniej zostaną zaznaczone jako uszkodzone i realokowane.</description>

      <description>Ruski serwer WWW ma przydatną funkcję serwowania wersji plików skompresowanych gzip&amp;rsquo;em - przez co możemy plik skompresować raz i będzie on serwowany klientom obsługującym kompresję HTTP ale już bez każdorazowego kompresowania go. Jest to bardzo przydatne na stronach z dużym ruchem gdzie można w ten sposób zaoszczędzić takty CPU na właściwą obsługę połączeń a nie kompresję. Drugie miejsce gdzie może to być przydatne to VPS&amp;rsquo;y i &amp;ldquo;cienkie&amp;rdquo; serwery, które na kompresji przy większym obciążeniu spędzają zbyt dużo czasu i daje się to odczuć w działaniu strony.</description>

      <description>Gdy już się dorobi systemu Active Directory wygodnie jest wykorzystać jego bazę użytkowników do autoryzacji w różnych miejscach, np. do pewnych &amp;ldquo;tajnych i tajniejszych&amp;rdquo; stron w Apache. Najprościej można to zrobić z wykorzystaniem LDAP.
Warto sprawdzić czy i jak możemy dostać się do kontrolerów. Gdy już mamy wszystkie potrzebne parametry konfigurujemy Apachego - na początek aktywujemy moduły:
a2enmod ldap a2enmod authnz_ldap Teraz możemy edytujemy globalny plik konfiguracyjny mod_ldap&amp;rsquo;a by ustawić nieco cache&amp;rsquo;y (bardzo przydatne).</description>

Testowałem różne długości łańcuchów i zauważyłem że zwiększanie długości łańcucha bardzo szybko powoduje znaczne zwiększenie ilości kolizji, co drastycznie obniżało wydajność (nie wspominając o czasie potrzebnym na wygenerowanie całej tablicy). Z tego powodu ostateczna implementacja choć była rzeczywiście tęczową tablicą działała bardziej jak tablica hashy - bo łańcuchy były bardzo krótkie.</description>

      <description>Po zakupie nowych dysków zamierzam utworzyć zdegradowaną macierz RAID5 z dwóch dysków (na trzecim na razie znajdują się dane), potem utworzyć wolumen LVM, sformatować go, przekopiować dane z pojedynczego dysku na macierz i dołączyć trzeci dysk do macierzy odbudowując parzystość. Zadanie będzie o tyle ciekawe że dysk ma 4KB sektory i trzeb będzie dbać o wyrównanie zasobu do rozmiaru sektora, a w przypadku LVM&amp;rsquo;a wyrównanie do chunk&amp;rsquo;a z macierzy.
Prawidłowe wyrównanie partycji Kupując nowy dysk (o pojemności od 500GB w górę), mamy spore szanse że trafimy na sztukę, która wykorzystuje 4KB sektory do alokacji danych.</description>

Warto w tym celu wykorzystać zestaw heirloom-mailx + ssmtp. hairloom-mailx jest prostym shellowym klientem SMTP - przy okazji linkuje polecenie mail (przydatne w skryptach). ssmtp pełni funkcję serwera SMTP ale nie działa jako demon - proces uruchamia się gdy jest potrzebny i znika po wysłaniu maili.</description>

Chciałem go ukryć (choćby w Nautilusie) by mnie nie drażnił.

Usługa działała np. 3 godziny by potem się położyć, albo nigdy nie wstawała po starcie systemu - po prostu jakaś masakra. Zgłoszenia do producenta często wyglądały tak że w jego testowym środowisku błędu nie udaje się powtórzyć (i nic dziwnego bo nie sądzę by z ich konfiguracji korzystali rzeczywiści użytkownicy).</description>

Jest to system statystyk aspirujący do bycia Open Source&amp;rsquo;ową alternatywą dla Google Analytics. Aspirujący (a nie będący) z tego względu że Google przechodząc na domyślny HTTPS (SPDY) dla zalogowanych użytkowników uniemożliwił śledzenie stron z których pochodzą odwiedziny (tzw. refferals) - tym prostym sposobem tylko GA jest w stanie dostarczyć pełnych informacji o wszystkich użytkownikach.</description>

Doskonały przykład to mój niedawny wpis: Apache: ograniczenie dostępu dla zalogowanych użytkowników z mod_rewrite i mod_auth_basic.
Zachodzi tam sytuacja, w której katalog użytkownika jest jego loginem małymi literami (bądź dużymi - jak kto woli), a użytkownik wpisując login może użyć zarówno małych jak i dużych liter i tutaj zaczyna się jazda.</description>

      <description>Obecnie dostępna jest już beta 2 Debiana Wheezy i utrzymywane są aktualizacje bezpieczeństwa więc powolutku można na testowych maszynach sprawdzać co i jak się zmieniło.
Ponieważ do finalnej wersji pewnie sporo się jeszcze zmieni to postaram się z czasem aktualizować ten post by zawierał bieżące informacje.
W razie wątpliwości patrz tutaj: http://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting

      <description>Dziś TIP z przeciwnego obozu - oprócz linuksowych systemów administruję również paroma serwerami windowsowymi i tutaj również (a czasem nawet bardziej) uda mi się znaleźć coś wartego zapamiętania.
Jedna z najbardziej charakterystycznych rzeczy na komputerach przyłączonych do domeny Windows to wyświetlanie &amp;ldquo;różnych dziwnych rzeczy&amp;rdquo; przy starcie systemu. Zarówno na Windowsie 2000 jak i na XP&amp;rsquo;ku na małym okienku przewijają informacje o aktualizacji polityk, instalacji oprogramowania itp&amp;hellip;
Zachowanie to zmieniło się na Vistach i 7-kach, które są nieco mniej rozmowne i wyświetlają jedynie komunikat typu &amp;ldquo;Trwa uruchamianie systemu&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; i tyla&amp;hellip; Załóżmy że wrzucimy do instalacji kilka paczek i jeszcze zmienimy kilka polityk i przez to komputer na tym napisie zatrzyma się na 5~10 minut - co zrobi użyszkodnik po 3 minutach?</description>

      <description>Gdy administruje się dużymi stronami internetowymi raz na czas np. po większych zmianach w konfiguracji zachodzi potrzeba sprawdzenia czy na stronie nie ma stron prowadzących donikąd. O ile w małych serwisach można samemu szybko przeklikać się przez stronkę to dla starych rozrośniętych serwisów nie jest to takie proste.
Jest kilka narzędzi których można użyć do testowania linków na stronach - każde z nich ma swoje zalety i wady, postaram się je przybliżyć.</description>

Jeżeli masz szczęście to posiadasz nie pojedynczy napęd a autoloader obsługujący wiele taśm i wiesz że najlepiej gdy taśmy są opisane kodami paskowymi które autoloader potrafi rozpoznać. Dzięki temu nie ma potrzeby odczytywania nr. seryjnego z taśmy tylko szybciutko skanerem kodów. Tasiemki można kupować już z kodami ale tańsze są te bez kodów&amp;hellip; i tu pytanie - czy da się tanio zdobyć etykiety?</description>

      <description>Szkoda że polecenia do obsługi NFS&amp;rsquo;a nie zaczynają się od nfs* - łatwiej byłoby mi je zapamiętać. A jednym z takich, zapominanych najczęściej jest listowanie zasobów, szczególnie przydatne gdy korzysta się z NFS&amp;rsquo;a na jakimś NAS&amp;rsquo;ie (którego magiczny soft nie pokazuje gdzie i co eksportuje):
showmount -e 192.168.1.10 Export list for 192.168.1.10: /mnt/pools/A/A0/Music * /mnt/pools/A/A0/Movies * /mnt/pools/A/A0/Backups * /mnt/pools/A/A0/Pictures * /mnt/pools/A/A0/Documents * Teraz możemy zamontować zasób:

      <description>Niedawno trafiłem na ciekawy problem w mod_rewrite - by przekierowywać użytkowników logujących się jednym z modułów mod_auth_basic do dedykowanych im katalogów, równocześnie blokując dostęp do katalogów innych użytkowników. Nie brzmi to jakoś strasznie ale problem okazał się być całkiem nietrywialnym. Teoretyczne rozwiązanie sprowadzało się do wyszukania loginu użytkownika ze ścieżki URI i porównania z nazwą użytkownika ze zmiennej %{REMOTE_USER} - jeśli wartości się różnią to Forbidden. Ale szybko okazało się że w RewriteCond zmienne z dopasowań można podstawiać tylko w pierwszym parametrze i że o ile można RewriteCond&amp;rsquo;y połączyć wyrażeniami logicznymi typu AND/OR to nie ma możliwości porównania czy dopasowania z kolejnych RewriteCond&amp;rsquo;ów są identyczne.</description>

Nie lubię gnome-terminal&#39;a bo domyślnie binduje F10 co wnerwia mnie w midnight commanderze, stąd szukałem i szukałem i jak dotychczas najbardziej podpasował mi unicode-rxvt. Można uruchamiać go po prostu jako urxvt lub uruchomić demona urxvtd po zalogowaniu i potem odpalać tylko klienta urxvtc. Druga metoda skutkuje natychmiastowym startem terminala, wiec gdy podbinduję go sobie pod F12 mam terminal zawsze pod ręką w mniej niż sekundę.</description>

Utworzenie pliku /forcefsck Pierwsza metoda polega na utworzeniu pliku forcefsck w głównym katalog, robimy to poniższym poleceniem:

      <description>Jedną z rzeczy, które podobają mi się w maszynach wirtualnych Xen jest możliwość zrobienia backupu całego obrazu i szybkie odzyskanie już w trakcie ciężkiej awarii. Gdy dodatkowo korzysta się z LVM&amp;rsquo;a to można na chwilę wyłączyć DomU, utworzyć snapshot jego dysków, uruchomić DomU i w trakcie działania robić spójny backup ze snapshot&amp;rsquo;a. Dzięki takiemu mechanizmowi serwer jest niedostępny przez kilkanaście sekund, a backup spójny jakby został wykonany przy całkowicie wyłączonej maszynie.</description>

      <description>Kiedyś poproszono mnie o przeszukanie wszystkich plików php na serwerze webowym po kątem wywołania pewnej funkcji. Oczywiste wydało mi się użycie rekurencyjnie grep&amp;rsquo;a, więc:
grep -R &amp;#34;JAKAS_FUNKCJA&amp;#34; /var/www/*.php Ale szybko okazało się że grep dopasowuje maskę *.php również do katalogów, więc nie przeszukiwał katalogów które nie kończyły się na .php ehhh&amp;hellip;..
Drugie podejście okazało się trafniejsze - najpierw poleceniem find wyszukuję wszystkie pliki php, a dopiero później grepuję (wypisując nazwę pliku i numer linii):</description>

      <description>To raczej nie jest podstawowy konfig i próżno szukać go na stronie WordPress&amp;rsquo;a, więc odradzam tę zabawę jeśli nie zna się zbyt dobrze nginx&amp;rsquo;a.
Ponieważ serwerek, na którym działa stronka to sprzęcik z Atomem 330 i mocy na CPU zbyt wiele nie ma to popularne pluginy (np. W3 Total Cache) potencjalnie zwiększające wydajność tak na prawdę zmulały stronkę jeszcze bardziej. Pluginów sprawdziłem kilka i każdorazowo efekt był podobny - stronka działała wolniej niż bez ich pomocy.</description>

xen-create - dla którego przygotowałem dość skomplikowaną konfigurację przy okazji wcześniejszego posta: Instalacja i konfiguracja DomU. Przykład użycia: xen-create --hostname example-domu --ip 10.0.0.77 \ --gateway 10.0.0.1 --broadcast 10.0.0.255 --netmask 255.255.255.0 \ --bridge br10 --vcpus 2 --memory=2G xen-delete-image - narzędzie do kasowania wirtualnych maszyn.</description>

      <description>Ustawienie domyślnego vhosta w nginx&amp;rsquo;ie jest ładnie opisane w dokumentacji i początkowo wydawało się dobrze działać ale gdy wykorzystałem tą konfigurację na serwerze z wieloma adresami IP i nasłuchiwaniem na porcie 80 (bez podania IP) to zachowywało się to dość dziwnie (przeważnie nie ładowało tej strony którą chciałem). Od teraz tworzę konfigurację domyślnego vhosta dla każdego z dostępnych adresów IP. Powiem szczerze że nie miałem czasu na głębsze zbadanie tego zachowania i wykorzystałem rozwiązanie, które działało w każdym przypadku czyli po jednym konfigu na IP + przekierowanie na ogólną stronę.</description>

      <description>VLAN&amp;rsquo;y są prostą metodą na separację sieci. Gdy mamy wiele sieci może zajść potrzeba by poszczególne DomU miały dostęp do różnych VLAN&amp;rsquo;ów (czasem nawet wielu równocześnie). Jeżeli serwer z Dom0 posiada minimum giga-bitową kartę sieciową (a najlepiej kilka) to powinniśmy być w stanie z godziwą jakością udostępnić systemom DomU różne VLAN&amp;rsquo;y z interfejsów gospodarza.
Zaprezentowane poniżej skrypty zapożyczyłem z tej strony: http://renial.net/weblog/2007/02/27/xen-vlan
Na początek musimy zainstalować pakiet vlan:
apt-get install vlan Później w pliku /etc/xen/xend-config.</description>

      <description>Ostatnio trafiłem na ciekawy problem, który wielokrotnie rozwiązywałem w nginx&amp;rsquo;ie ale tym razem musiałem zrobić to w Apache. Pewna stronka działa sobie na HTTPS&amp;rsquo;ie i chciałem by wszystkie powiązane z nią pliki były serwowane z jej adresu szyfrowanym połączeniem by nie pojawiały się w przeglądarce monity że &amp;ldquo;część ruchu nie jest szyfrowana&amp;rdquo;. Tyle że część potrzebnych plików była już obecnie serwowana na innym serwerze (w innej domenie) poprzez HTTP.
Mogłem albo skopiować te pliki i wykombinować jakiś mechanizm synchronizujący albo wykorzystać proxy + cache.</description>

      <description>Gdy tworzymy pierwszą aplikację webową, która umożliwia upload plików przeważnie lądują one lokalnie w pewniej lokalizacji. Gdy druga aplikacja potrzebuje dostępu do tych plików wystarczy podać ścieżkę. Problemy zaczynają się gdy aplikacji jest kilka i rozmieszczonych na kilku serwerach. Można korzystać z sieciowych systemów plików ale to często nie jest zbyt wygodne - ciężko odpowiednio ustawić uprawnienia by pewne aplikacje miały dostęp do zapisu plików a inne nie, trzeba skonfigurować dany katalog w kilku miejscach w konfiguracji serwera WWW aby serwować pliki itp&amp;hellip;</description>

Powiększenie wolumenu LVM (np. o 10 gigabajtów):

      <description>Aby wybrane systemy DomU startowały automatycznie po restarcie hypervisora należy podlinkować ich pliki konfiguracyjne w katalogu /etc/xen/auto po uprzednim jego utworzeniu. Przykładowo:
mkdir /etc/xen/auto ln -s /etc/xen/example.cfg /etc/xen/auto/example.cfg Od teraz DomU example będzie startować automatycznie.</description>

      <description>Ostatnio pisałem o konfiguracji Dom0 - dzisiaj napiszę o uruchamianiu DomU.
Do instalacji DomU wykorzystuję skrypty z pakietu xen-tools, można go zainstalować poleceniem:
apt-get install xen-tools Oczywiście aby wszystko działało fajnie musimy ustawić kilka domyślnych opcji, robimy to edytując plik /etc/xen-tools/xen-tools.conf. Lecimy po kolei:
# Virtual machine disks are created as logical volumes in # volume group &amp;#39;universe&amp;#39; (hint: LVM storage is much faster # than file) lvm = universe Osobiście korzystam z LVM&amp;rsquo;a który zgodnie z hint&amp;rsquo;em jest znacznie szybszy od plików obrazów.</description>

      <description>Po co mi to? Wiele razy miałem do czynienia z serwerami na których działało kilka/kilkanaście usług równocześnie, np. Apache (kilka stronek, webmail, phpmyadmin, itp), Postfix/Exim (poczta i żeby było fajnie to na kontach systemowych), Samba (jakieś zasoby dla pracowników), MySQL (baza dla stronek), PostgreSQL (bo jedna stronka potrzebowała), itd&amp;hellip;. Przy takiej konfiguracji pomijane są kwestie separacji usług zewnętrznych/wewnętrznych - no ale firma/instytucja mała nie ma sensu kasy na 3 kolejne serwery wydawać skoro działa&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Jakiś czas temu korzystałem z preload&amp;rsquo;a który sam uczył się jakie aplikacje odpalam i te programy ładował już podczas startu - przeważnie nieco spowalnia to start systemu ale gdy już się załaduje to programy, które uruchamiam jako pierwsze startują &amp;ldquo;z kopa&amp;rdquo;. Od jakiegoś czasu popularniejszy jest instalowany domyślnie w Ubuntu ureadahead - pełni on podobną funkcję jak preload.
Można zmusić ureadahead do ponownego wygenerowania nowej listy programów wczytywanych przy starcie do cache a oto jak zrobić:</description>

      <description>Aby umożliwić odwiedzającym nasze strony cachowanie obrazków (tak by nie musieli pobierać ich każdorazowo bo przecież nie zmieniają się aż tak często) konieczne jest ustawienie nagłówków: Cache-Control, Expires dla odpowiednich typów plików. W Apachem jest do tego dedykowany moduł - mod_expires. W Debianie dostarczany jest on bez domyślnej globalnej konfiguracji - a ja lubię gdy cacheuje mi się większość statyki. Zawsze można dostosować czas cachowania pod siebie względem określonego typu pliku, np.</description>

Taki objaw przeważnie jest skutkiem problemów z działaniem DNS&amp;rsquo;a po stronie klienta lub serwera. Warto sprawdzić poleceniami host/dig/nslookup po obu stronach jak dużo czasu potrzeba na rozwiązanie nazw. Najlepiej rozwiązać problem z DNS&amp;rsquo;em ustawiając szybkie serwery ale gdy nie mamy takiej możliwości to po stronie serwera można ustawić w /etc/sshd_config opcję:</description>

W między czasie znalazłem chwilę by pobawić się Empathy - brzydki, nie ma przeglądarki usług XMPP, ale wyszukiwanie na rosterze jest dokładnie takie jakiego szukałem (w miarę wpisywania znaków zawęża listę kontaktów by pasowały do wpisywanego wzorca).
Tyle że skróty klawiaturowe w tym programie zwyczajnie mnie rozwalają - przez lata przyzwyczaiłem się że okienka czatu można zamknąć Escape&amp;rsquo;m - a tutaj nawet nie ma opcji, która pozwalała by na taką zmianę zachowania.</description>

      <description>Można znaleźć wiele tutoriali jakimi narzędziami wykonywać backupy. W większości przypadków absolutnie wystarczający okaże się flexbackup. Bardziej wymagający wykorzystają BackupPC, Baculę lub Amandę. Narzędzia te pozwalają wykonać kopie pełne, różnicowe, przyrostowe - kompresując je dla zaoszczędzenia miejsca.
Wszystko fajnie - ale problemy pojawiają się przy dostępie do tych danych. Żeby odzyskać plik zmodyfikowany dzisiaj trzeba rozpakować najpierw kopię pełną, potem różnicową, przyrostową by wreszcie wyciągnąć plik z wczoraj&amp;hellip; hmm ten też jest skopany.</description>

Drugim fajnym zastosowaniem tego triku jest możliwość wykorzystania iPlusa jako &amp;ldquo;zapasowego łącza&amp;rdquo; w przypadku awarii głównego.
Dzięki pomocy inżyniera Fortigate szybko udało mi się zebrać potrzebne do działania parametry, które należy uruchomić poprzez command line (telnet/ssh).</description>

      <description>Wcześniej czy później zawsze pojawia się potrzeba zoptymalizowania naszej bazy MySQL. Przedstawię kilka zmian w konfiguracji, które powinny zwiększyć wydajność w większości przypadków.
MyISAM - key_buffer_size Najprostszą optymalizacją baz/tabel z mechanizmem MyISAM jest odpowiednie dobranie bufora na cache dla kluczy i indeksów (dane nigdy nie są cachowane). Poniższe zapytanie pozwala oszacować zalecany rozmiar cache&amp;rsquo;u:
SELECT CONCAT(ROUND(KBS/POWER(1024, IF(PowerOf1024&amp;lt;0,0,IF(PowerOf1024&amp;gt;3,0,PowerOf1024)))+0.4999), SUBSTR(&amp;#39; KMG&amp;#39;,IF(PowerOf1024&amp;lt;0,0, IF(PowerOf1024&amp;gt;3,0,PowerOf1024))+1,1)) recommended_key_buffer_size FROM (SELECT LEAST(POWER(2,32),KBS1) KBS FROM (SELECT SUM(index_length) KBS1 FROM information_schema.</description>

Tworzymy plik: /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/dovecot.conf

By poradzić sobie z tym problemem trzeba na serwerze reverse proxy ustawić przekazywanie informacji o oryginalnym adresie IP klienta w nagłówku X-Forwarded-For. W przypadku gdy reverse proxy działa na nginx&amp;rsquo;e wystarczy dodać taki wpis:</description>

      <description>Przez pewien czas korzystałem z eAcceleratora do przyspieszenia działania stron pisanych w PHP&amp;rsquo;ie ale czasem bywał niestabilny. Aktualizacje pojawiały się rzadko a od czasu do czasu miewałem problemy ze stabilnością tej wtyczki na kilku bardziej skomplikowanych aplikacjach. Zdarzało się że pomimo zmiany kodu w skrypcie php, eAccelerator serwował wciąż stary plik - konieczny był restart Apache&amp;rsquo;go by wszystko działało jak trzeba.
Zacząłem szukać alternatywy i trafiłem na dwa moduły:

Trudno wybrać domeny, dla których warto by zrezygnować z greylistingu, itd, itp&amp;hellip;

      <description>Pomimo iż Linux uchodzi za stabilne środowisko to raz na jakiś czas trafi się ciężka zwiecha - z powodu przeciążenia, awarii sprzętu&amp;hellip; nieistotne&amp;hellip;
Załóżmy że licho wzięło za cel główny serwer plików lub bazę danych dla wielu, wielu stron internetowych. Dostać się po ssh nie możemy bo lecą timeout&amp;rsquo;y, a siedząc bezpośrednio przy klawiaturze konsola nie reaguje. Mimo to coś ostro daje po dyskach, więc ewentualny twardy reset to na bank utrata części plików&amp;hellip; jeśli system po nim w ogóle wstanie&amp;hellip; &amp;#x1f611;</description>

      <description>Wielu administratorów gdy zaczyna swoją przygodę zarządza jedną/dwoma maszynami&amp;hellip; Po pewnym czasie jest ich już kilka&amp;hellip; W którymś momencie dostrzega się zalety wirtualizacji i na kilku maszynach fizycznych działa kilkanaście czy kilkadziesiąt maszyn wirtualnych. W takiej sytuacji pobieranie aktualizacji dla wszystkich maszyn potrafi mocno zabić łącze.
I w tym momencie zaczynamy się zastanawiać czy może nie warto byłoby zrobić własnego mirror&amp;rsquo;a paczek dla naszego ulubionego distro&amp;hellip; do prywatnego użytku&amp;hellip; synchronizowanego w nocy by nikomu nie przeszkadzać&amp;hellip; i dostępnego nawet gdy będziemy offline&amp;hellip; Zaczynamy liczyć miejsce i okazuje się że repozytorium Debiana dla architektury i386 to prawie 60GB (sic!</description>

      <description>Linux bardzo agresywnie wykorzystuje wolną pamięć RAM do buforowania danych odczytywanych z dysków (inode&amp;rsquo;ów, plików, itd&amp;hellip;). Ma to niebagatelny wpływ na zwiększenie szybkości uruchamiania programów które już raz zostały uruchomione. Jednak nie zawsze jest to pożądane zachowanie, np. testując szybkość uruchomienia/wykonywania tworzonej przez nas aplikacji - buforowanie zmienia czas ładowania aplikacji przy kolejnych uruchomieniach. Dobrze byłoby móc wymusić zwolnienie buforów by każdy start programu miał porównywalne &amp;ldquo;warunki startowe&amp;rdquo;.
Na szczęście można to zrobić w prosty sposób:</description>

      <description>Od jakiegoś czasu dostępny jest w sieci skrypt slowloris.pl pozwalający z pojedynczego komputera wykonać atak DOS na zdalny serwer WWW. Atak polega na uruchomieniu wielu równoczesnych sesji i bardzo wolnym wysyłaniu komunikatów HTTP. Atakujący udaje &amp;ldquo;klienta z wolnym łączem&amp;rdquo; równocześnie uruchamiając kolejne sesje by po pewnym czasie zająć wszystkie dostępne. Serwer WWW przestaje wtedy odpowiadać na zapytania od innych klientów. Dodatkowo na źle wyskalowanych serwerach duża liczba procesów Apachego może spowodować swapowanie i błędy braku pamięci.</description>

      <description>Na jednym z serwerów zauważyłem dziwny wzrost obciążenia. Tzw. LOAD od kilku dni po woli rósł. top pokazywał że dwa rdzenie CPU czekają na dane z dysku - tzw. io wait na poziomie 80~90% ale żaden proces w znaczącym stopniu nie obciążał CPU.
Jest kilka narzędzi (iostat, wmstat), które pozwalają monitorować obciążenie dysków ale ja nie szukałem informacji czy i w jakim stopniu dyski są obciążone - wiedziałem że są. Chciałem dowiedzieć się który proces generuje to obciążenie - by móc go ubić &amp;#x1f603;</description>

      <description>Onego czasu próbowałem znaleźć coś co ułatwiłoby mi rysowanie prostych wykresów w PHP&amp;rsquo;ie inaczej niż z palca w GD. Kumpel polecił mi JPGraph.
JPGraph to świetna sprawa, do generowania statystyk jak chociażby na mojej stronie, ale biblioteka potrafi dużo więcej&amp;hellip;
Załóżmy, że ze stronki zbieramy do bazy takie rzeczy jak: datę, adres IP, ilość połączeń z tego adresu. Prosta tabela (przykład w Postgre SQL&amp;rsquo;u):
CREATE TABLE wizyty ( pid serial NOT NULL, &amp;#34;data&amp;#34; date NOT NULL DEFAULT (&amp;#39;now&amp;#39;::text)::date, odslony integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1, CONSTRAINT visits_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id) ); Dane z takiej tabeli można łatwo wyciągnąć jednym select&amp;rsquo;em:</description>

      <description>Tak się składa, że Debian ze względu na stosunkowo rzadkie wydawanie kolejnych wersji szybko staje się niezbyt świeży a dostępne w nim pakiety często nie spełaniają naszych oczekiwań. Nie ma najnowszej wersji Subversion&amp;hellip; Nie ma mod_security itd, itp&amp;hellip;
Rozwiązaniem tego problemu może być instalacja pakietów z testowej gałęzi ale można polec na zależnościach. Można też kompilować ze źródeł&amp;hellip; Tak czy siak w obu przypadkach aktualizacja i utrzymanie tak zmodyfikowanego systemu byłoby jak wrzód na zadku.</description>

      <description>Przy okazji wykonywania kilku drobnych optymalizacji swojej stronki natknąłem się na eAccelerator&amp;rsquo;a. Ciekawy projekt, który w sposobie działania przypomina Zend Optimizer&amp;rsquo;a ale ma jedną zasadniczą zaletę - jest darmowy &amp;#x1f603;
Niestety nie ma go w repozytoriach Debiana, więc trzeba go sobie skompilować - cały proces jest dość prosty. Zaczynamy od pobrania najświeższej paczki, obecnie jest to wersja 0.9.5.3:

      <description>Co prawda na swojej stronie zrobiłem kilka podstawowych statystyk i coś tam sobie loguję do bazy danych, ale gdyby się chwilę zastanowić to przecież to samo robi serwer www - wrzuca do logów każde zapytanie HTTP, kod błędu, nazwę agenta, itd. Dublowanie tych danych nie jest najbardziej optymalne.
Stąd też chwilę pogooglałem i znalazłem świetny Open Source&amp;rsquo;owy projekt: AWStats, który jest webowym analizatorem logów dla serwerów HTTP, FTP i SMTP.</description>

      <description>Certyfikaty oparte o SSL stanowią obecnie podstawę bezpieczeństwa wielu usług sieciowych zaczynając od HTTP, przez POPS, IMAPS, itd&amp;hellip; Niestety zakupienie certyfikatu w organizacjach jak VeriSgin czy Thawte jest dość kosztowe, a jeżeli potrzebujemy kilka certyfikatów to często na lokalne potrzeby jest to po prostu nie opłacalne.
Postaram się przedstawić wersję &amp;ldquo;ekonomiczną&amp;rdquo; certyfikacji &amp;#x1f603;
Generowanie Certificate Signing Request Pierwszym etapem generowania certyfikatu jest przygotowanie Certificate Signing Request, czyli czegoś w rodzaju &amp;ldquo;prośby&amp;rdquo; o certyfikat.</description>

      <description>Mój serwer pocztowy działa od jakiegoś czasu na dynamicznym IP (dobre bo tanie&amp;hellip;) i przeważnie nie ma z tym problemów. Postarałem się jak mogłem ustawiając SPF&amp;rsquo;a i DomainKeys aby uwiarygodnić go u większych dostawców poczty.
Niestety wszystko to diabli biorą w momencie gdy wygasa mi leasse DHCP i dostaję nowe IP po jakimś spamerze/zombiaku. Wisi takie w 2-3 większych RBL&amp;rsquo;ach i o dostarczaniu poczty można zapomnieć. Miło gdy jeszcze zdalny MTA zechce odesłać zwrotkę &amp;ldquo;zróbta coś bo wisisz w RBL&amp;rsquo;u takim a takim&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, ale zdecydowania niefajnie gdy wysyłasz pocztę a ona od razu leci do /dev/null rblcheck Poszperałem trochę i znalazłem fajne narzędzie aka rblcheck, które sprawdza domyślnie kilka RBL&amp;rsquo;i.</description>

      <description>Klastrowanie to może zbyt dumnie powiedziane. Rozwiązanie to wyszukałem gdy chcąc skonfigurować dwa serwery apache do współpracy na rzecz jednego serwisu okazało się, że sejse trzymane są tylko przez jeden serwer a drugi nic o nich nie wie. To oczywiście nie pozwalało na prawidłowe działanie jakiegokolwiek serwisu korzystającego z sesji.
Pomysł jest taki, że zastępujemy domyśny mechanizm przechowywania sesji w plikach na dysku mechanizmem memcache. Ponieważ memcached działa jako usługa sieciowa, różne serwery mogą się odwoływać do puli memcached i odczytywać zapisane w niej dane.</description>

      <description>Instalacja serwera MySQL na Debianie jest niezwykle prosta i sprowadza się do jednego polecenia:
sudo apt-get install mysql-server Polecenie to zainstaluje i uruchomi usługę serwerową MySQL. W czasie instalacji będziemy proszeni o podanie hasła dla root&amp;rsquo;a (które oczywiście dobrze jest zapamiętać bądź zapisać).
Tak zainstalowana baza nasłuchuje na lokalnym porcie (localhost:3306) umożliwiająć dostęp wyłącznie root&amp;rsquo;owi. Jest to bardzo bezpieczna konfiguracja&amp;hellip; Ale jeśli nie mamy zamiaru na tej samej maszynie instalować oprogramowania zarządzającego to nie zawsze jest to wygodne, tym bardziej gdy przykładowo mamy działającego phpmyadmin&amp;rsquo;a na jakimś serwerze www.</description>

      <description>Większość systemów plików w linuksie pozwala na ustawienie quoty na dwóch poziomach: na użytkownika lub na grupę użytkowników. W wielu przypadkach taki podział jest sensowny i wystarczający. Ale zdarzają się scenariusze, w których to za mało.
Dobrym przykładem jest serwer FTP z wirtualnymi kontami użytkowników. Czyli usługa serwera działa jako pewien nieuprzywilejowany użytkownik systemowy (przeważnie ftp) przypisany do nieuprzywilejowanej grupy (np. nogroup). Konta użytkowników serwera FTP są zdefiniowane w bazie danych lub serwerze LDAP.</description>

Sporo się nakombinowałem aby wygenerować dużo kombinacji szczególnie pod kątem polskich haseł (wszystkie: misiaczki, dupeczki, itp&amp;hellip;) razem z różnymi popularnymi modyfikacjami (typu: misiaczki1, DUPECZKI, etc&amp;hellip;).</description>

Jest pewna prosta sztuczka, pozwalająca wbić się na konto root&amp;rsquo;a nie znając hasła - dając nam możliwość jego zmiany. Potrzebne dwa restarty ale za to nie trzeba korzystać z żadnychlive cd.</description>
