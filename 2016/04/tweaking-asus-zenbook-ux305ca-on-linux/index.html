I started with fresh Ubuntu 16.04 to get Debian based distro with possibly latest kernel and patches.\nSome SSD tweaks Change mount options for filesystems on SSD from:\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root / ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 1 to:\n/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root / ext4 discard,noatime,errors=remount-ro 0 1 And move /tmp to RAM with this additional line in /etc/fstab:\ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0 Now add deadline scheduler for root disk - edit /etc/rc.local and add this line before exit 0:\necho deadline \u003e /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler echo 1 \u003e /sys/block/sda/queue/iosched/fifo_batch I have configured swap but I don’t want to use it too much and setting low swappines sysctl option will help. Run this as root:\necho \"vm.swappiness = 1\" \u003e /etc/sysctl.conf.d/90-swappines.conf sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf.d/90-swappines.conf Power usage tweaks I’ve installed laptop-mode-tools to achieve lower power usage on battery. So:\napt-get install -y laptop-mode-tools By default it’s cutting hard CPU performance on battery (half performance, no turbo) so I fixed this by changing /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/intel_pstate.conf section On battery:\n#On battery BATT_INTEL_PSTATE_PERF_MIN_PCT=0 # Minimum performance, in percent BATT_INTEL_PSTATE_PERF_MAX_PCT=100 # Maximum performance, in percent BATT_INTEL_PSTATE_NO_TURBO=0 # Disable \"Turbo Boost\"? Laptop mode tools won’t start automatically so we may integrate them with pm-utils (that are already installed on Ubuntu) to get it running when needed. We have to create new config file:\nsudo touch /etc/pm/sleep.d/10-laptop-mode-tools sudo chmod a+x /etc/pm/sleep.d/10-laptop-mode-tools with content like this:\ncase $1 in hibernate) /etc/init.d/laptop-mode stop ;; suspend) /etc/init.d/laptop-mode stop ;; thaw)d /etc/init.d/laptop-mode start ;; resume) /etc/init.d/laptop-mode start ;; *) echo Something is not right. ;; esac Now I will enable ALPM for SATA in AHCI mode optimizations:\necho SATA_ALPM_ENABLE=true | sudo tee /etc/pm/config.d/sata_alpm And some kernel parameters in /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"pcie_aspm=force drm.vblankoffdelay=1 i915.semaphores=1\" and update-grub with:\nupdate-grub You may use powertop to nail power heavy processes. There is also powerstat to benchmark power usage through time - I have:\nsudo pm-powersave true powerstat ...... Summary: System: 4.49 Watts on average with standard deviation 0.46 It’s really nice.

There is solution for that, it’s even installed by default on Ubuntu and it’s called: syndaemon. It’s started by default like this:\nsyndaemon -i 1.0 -t -K -R 1 second feels too small for me. I will adjust it to 2s. There is no easy way to do this. I created script to run on login:\n#!/bin/bash killall syndaemon syndaemon -d -i 2.0 -t -K -R Now better 🙂\nVD-PAU I installed vdpauinfo tool to see if it’s working:\napt-get install -y vdpauinfo It wasn’t:\nvdpauinfo display: :0 screen: 0 Failed to open VDPAU backend libvdpau_va_gl.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Error creating VDPAU device: 1 I checked this library and couldn’t find it - it wasn’t installed.

Sources https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPGPU#Intel external link Suspend/Hibernate on lid close Default configuration of Ubuntu 16.04 was that after I close lid screen was blocked and LCD disabled. But system was still working normally - I strongly prefer to hibernate in such case and use no battery at all.\nI achieved that with systemd-logind. Edit /etc/systemd/logind.conf and uncomment line with HandleLidSwitch:\n[Login] HandleLidSwitch=suspend HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore Now restart systemd-logind service with:\nsystemctl restart systemd-logind.service Problem with function keys Function keys were mostly working but not always like I expected. For example when I disable touchpad - it’s not disabled 🙂\nI found that module asus-nb-wmi is responssible for that and it’s still buggy. So I disabled it at all with:\necho \"blacklist asus-nb-wmi\" \u003e /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-ux305.conf Volume UP/DOWN/MUTE are still working fine - that’s enough for me. Rest could be configured with some keyboard shortcuts - more info here external link .\nTODO/Issues I still face some bugs:\nI could see occasional flickering from time to time. Rather after running notebook for some time than overheating/overloading it. This may be driver issue or maybe SNA acceleration method - I have to experiment a little to get this solved.\nLooks like disabling Virtualization support and VT-d in BIOS helped. It’s not final solution but for now I don’t need it… A lot 😉 Tapping sometimes behave strange, for ex. tap to click stops to work and I have to use touchpad buttons for that. I think this may be related to syndaemon configuration because it started after I tuned it.\nIt was that. My hack for syndaemon broke touchpad. I will play with this a little more later. I like to use copy by selection and paste by middle click on my desktop - I’m addicted to this option but it’s not working on my laptop. I’m not sure if this will be convenient enough on touchpad to use.\nTo right click just tap with two fingers, to middle click (third button) tap with three fingers. Copy/paste is again easy like before. If you found errors in my text of know better solutions for described problems, please let me know in comments.\n","wordCount":"2163","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://gagor.pro/2016/04/tweaking-asus-zenbook-ux305ca-on-linux/generic-cover.webp","datePublished":"2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2026-01-05T20:24:09+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tom"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gagor.pro/2016/04/tweaking-asus-zenbook-ux305ca-on-linux/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tom's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gagor.pro/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gagor.pro/ accesskey=h title="Tom's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gagor.pro/favicon-36x36.avif alt="Page logo" aria-label=logo height=36>Tom's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Rather after running notebook for some time than overheating/overloading it. This may be driver issue or maybe SNA acceleration method - I have to experiment a little to get this solved.</del><br>Looks like disabling <del>Virtualization support and</del> VT-d in BIOS helped. It&rsquo;s not final solution but for now I don&rsquo;t need it&mldr; A lot 😉</li><li><del>Tapping sometimes behave strange, for ex. tap to click stops to work and I have to use touchpad buttons for that. I think this may be related to syndaemon configuration because it started after I tuned it.</del><br>It was that. My hack for syndaemon broke touchpad. I will play with this a little more later.</li><li><del>I like to use copy by selection and paste by middle click on my desktop - I&rsquo;m addicted to this option but it&rsquo;s not working on my laptop. I&rsquo;m not sure if this will be convenient enough on touchpad to use.</del><br>To right click just tap with two fingers, to middle click (third button) tap with three fingers.
