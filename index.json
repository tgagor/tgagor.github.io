[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of Markdown. I use it on this blog, in technical documentation, and pretty much whenever I can. I love the simplicity of writing without the need for complex, excessive syntax like XML or HTML. Markdown is also my go-to format when working with AI agents like ChatGPT.\nOne thing I always missed was the ability to create notes and present them effectively. Sure, I could show formatted text generated from Markdown, but those presentations never looked great. Without proper slide separation, people could see what was coming next, which ruined the top-down flow of a presentation.\nIt happened again recently. I had my notes and a plan for a presentation. I started crafting slides in PowerPoint. I found the company\u0026rsquo;s template, and 15 minutes later, I had the first and last slides ready. \u0026#x1f923;\nChoosing from different themes, colors, and layouts can be overwhelming when all I need is a few phrases to guide me and something for the audience to focus on. I already have those in my notes, but moving them into a presentation is tedious. Since I have to do this occasionally, I wanted to simplify the process.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when I found Marp1. It\u0026rsquo;s open-source, works on Mac and Linux (my main platforms), and is super easy to use.\nIf you have notes on a specific topic, you can ask any AI agent to summarize them in Markdown. With headers and bullet points, your slides are already halfway done.\nYou start with a frontmatter like this:\nExample slide deck --- marp: true theme: default --- \u0026lt;!-- Then add the first slide: --\u0026gt; # **My Title** *Title of slide* Author --- # Another title ... It uses \u0026ldquo;line separators\u0026rdquo; (---) to divide slides. The rest is pure Markdown, so you can use the usual syntax.\nNow, how do you make this convenient? Not being able to see the slides as you write wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make the process much easier. I usually code in VS Code, and there\u0026rsquo;s a plugin\u0026thinsp; external link that works well with Markdown Preview. Just hit ctrl/cmd + shift + m, and you can see your slides update in real time as you write, edit, or rearrange content.\nFor me, this is the most natural way to work—with text, like with code. I can easily keep it in a code repository, revert changes, compare versions, and so on.\nHacks Of course, there are well-documented features\u0026thinsp; external link , but some things require a bit of time to figure out.\nMulti-column split The first hack is a multi-column layout. By default, there\u0026rsquo;s none, but you can easily create one with a bit of HTML and CSS\u0026thinsp; external link .\nExample of multi-column design --- marp: true theme: default footer: Tomasz Gągor | gagor.pro style: | .columns { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr)); gap: 1rem; } --- # **This is a multi-column slide deck** \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;columns\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; * First column point 1 * Point 2 \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; Second column ![Amazing chart](../images/cover.webp) \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Here\u0026rsquo;s how it looks:\nConvert PDF to images with proper page numbers A final presentation in PDF format is usually good enough, but if I want to add it to my blog, I prefer to use images (PNG/Webp). This can be done with ImageMagick.\nI have two additional requirements:\nDouble-digit numbers (prefixed with zero), Starting with 1 as the first slide. All of this is possible with one command:\nConverting PDF slide decks to PNG images convert slide-decks.pdf -scene 1 slide-%02d.png Inverting the color scheme of slide decks This simple trick can \u0026ldquo;intensify\u0026rdquo; the impact when switching slide decks. Just invert the color scheme for the first, last, or any other important slide to visually \u0026ldquo;wake up\u0026rdquo; and grab the audience\u0026rsquo;s attention.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s as simple as adding this comment:\nInverting color scheme for a single slide \u0026lt;!-- _class: invert --\u0026gt; Check out these examples for the result: Enjoyed this post? https://marp.app/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2025/11/create-markdown-presentations-with-marp/","summary":"Learn how to create beautiful slide decks with Markdown and Marp, a simple and powerful tool for presentations.","title":"Create Markdown presentations with Marp"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been curious for a while about AI tools that can be used from the command line. While there are a few custom tools out there, the game-changer for me was the release of Gemini CLI\u0026thinsp; external link . The generous token limits on the free plan were particularly appealing.\nHowever, there\u0026rsquo;s one aspect I\u0026rsquo;m not fond of: it\u0026rsquo;s built on Node.js. The npm ecosystem is frequently targeted by supply chain attacks123, and I prefer not to clutter my system with Node and its many packages.\nMy solution was to run it in a Docker container. Since the official project doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide a Docker image and community-published ones aren\u0026rsquo;t always up-to-date, I did what I often do in these situations: I built my own and tailored it to my workflow.\nI started a new project on GitHub\u0026thinsp; external link to host the solution. This project automatically builds a Docker image with the latest version of Gemini CLI and Node, with weekly updates. If I encounter issues with a specific version, I can easily revert to a previous one. For me, this is much simpler than managing npm dependencies directly.\nThe simplest way to check it is: Simple run check docker run -ti --rm tgagor/gemini-cli --version Recommended Setup The best way to use this image is to create a shell function that handles the necessary mount points and permissions. Add the following function to your ~/.bash_aliases or ~/.zsh_aliases:\nCommand line wrapper function gemini { local tty_args=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; if [ -t 0 ]; then tty_args=\u0026#34;--tty\u0026#34; fi docker run -i ${tty_args} --rm \\ -v \u0026#34;$(pwd):/home/gemini/workspace\u0026#34; \\ -v \u0026#34;$HOME/.gemini:/home/gemini/.gemini\u0026#34; \\ -e DEFAULT_UID=$(id -u) \\ -e DEFAULT_GID=$(id -g) \\ tgagor/gemini-cli \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; } This setup does the following:\nMounts your current directory into /home/gemini/workspace inside the container. Persists your Gemini CLI configuration between runs by mounting ~/.gemini. Aligns the container\u0026rsquo;s user permissions with your local user\u0026rsquo;s to prevent file ownership problems. Correctly handles TTY for interactive sessions, allowing you to run it as an interactive command or pipe files to it. Usage Now I can call it as a native command:\nCommands examples # Get help gemini --help # Process a local file gemini your-prompt-file.txt # Pipe file as context cat doc.md | gemini -p \u0026#34;Correct grammar\u0026#34; # Use interactive mode gemini More commands you can find in official docs\u0026thinsp; external link .\nEnjoyed this post? https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/cloud-security/npm-supply-chain-attack/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/i/npm-supply-chain-attack.html\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.ox.security/blog/npm-2-0-hack-40-npm-packages-hit-in-major-supply-chain-attack/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2025/10/running-gemini-cli-in-a-docker-container/","summary":"Learn how to run Google\u0026rsquo;s Gemini CLI in a Docker container to avoid installing Node.js and its dependencies directly on your system.

Sure, I can promote posts on social media, but at some point I have to decide whether I want to contribute to the generic AI knowledge pool or not. That’s when I first came across the concept of Generative Engine Optimization (aka GEO).\nWhat is GEO? Simply put, GEO is like SEO (Search Engine Optimization), but for AI agents. It’s about making your content easier for large language models to understand and use when generating answers.\nThere are several ways to help AI agents “read” your site better:\nUse clean structure with proper headers. Write content that answers generic, high-level questions. Provide clear navigation and metadata (like OpenGraph1, JSON for Linking Data2). And - the interesting one - add a dedicated file describing your site for AI crawlers. That last one is what the llmstxt.org\u0026thinsp; external link initiative proposes - something like robots.txt, but for AI models.\nEssentially, it’s a simple Markdown file called /llms.txt in your site’s root directory. The format isn’t strictly defined, since LLMs can usually interpret whatever you write there.\nHow to add llms.txt to a Hugo blog If you’ve been here before, you know I use Hugo\u0026thinsp; external link 3 for blogging. It’s flexible and extensible - perfect for generating custom outputs like llms.txt.\nHere’s how to set it up.\n1. Update hugo.yaml Start by defining a custom media type and output format for llms.txt. Your configuration should look like this:\nExtend your Hugo config file with mediaTypes: text/llms: suffixes: [\u0026#34;txt\u0026#34;] outputFormats: llms: name: llms mediaType: text/llms baseName: llms isPlainText: true rel: alternate isHTML: false noUgly: true permalinkable: false outputs: home: # typical outputs - HTML - RSS # my addition - llms Depending on your existing configuration, you might need to merge this with other outputs, but this is the minimal working version.\n2. Create the llms.txt template Hugo will now look for a template under:\nlayouts/_default/home.llms.txt Create that file and add something like this:\nContent of my layouts/_default/home.llms.txt file \u0026lt;!-- ../../../../layouts/_default/home.llms.txt --\u0026gt; # Tom\u0026#39;s Blog ({{ absURL \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; }}) \u0026gt; Welcome to the personal blog of Tomasz Gągor, a passionate DevOps practitioner and Linux enthusiast dedicated to sharing insights on cloud security, containerized services, and practical IT leadership. ## About author {{- with .Site.GetPage \u0026#34;about\u0026#34; }} {{ .RawContent }} {{- end }} ## Licensing All pages on my site are licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). ## Languages supported English, Polish ## Main Navigation Links - [Home]({{ \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; | absURL }}): Main page, listing latest articles - [Projects]({{ \u0026#34;/projects/\u0026#34; | absURL }}): Github and Docker Hub projects where I\u0026#39;m active - [Bookshelf]({{ \u0026#34;/bookshelf/\u0026#34; | absURL }}): All the books I\u0026#39;ve read recently with their reviews - [Archive]({{ \u0026#34;/archives/\u0026#34; | absURL }}): List of all the articles on my blog, with links to them - [About]({{ \u0026#34;/about/\u0026#34; | absURL }}): Notes about the author {{- range $term, $value := .Site.Taxonomies }} - [{{ $term | title }}]({{ $term | absURL }}): Taxonomy page with all {{ $term | title }} {{- end }} ## Sitemap {{ \u0026#34;sitemap.xml\u0026#34; | absURL }} ## RSS/Atom feed {{ \u0026#34;index.xml\u0026#34; | absURL }} ## Contact Suggest contact with feedback about articles on the page, or just to share when they helped. {{- range site.Params.socialIcons }} {{- if not (in (slice \u0026#34;rss\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; \u0026#34;kofi\u0026#34; \u0026#34;buymeacoffee\u0026#34;) .name ) }} - [{{ (.title | default .name) | title }}]({{ trim .url \u0026#34; \u0026#34; | safeURL }}) {{- end }} {{- end }} This example is based on my blog setup - you’ll want to adapt it to your own structure and tone.

You can see the final generated file HERE .\nWrapping up Adding an llms.txt file to your Hugo site takes just a few lines of configuration and a simple template, but it can make your content more discoverable and understandable for AI systems. Whether it will directly bring back your organic traffic is another story - but at least you’ll help shape the next generation of the web.\nEnjoyed this post? https://ogp.me\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://json-ld.org\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://gohugo.io\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2025/10/how-to-add-llms.txt-to-a-hugo-blog/","summary":"Learn how to add an \u003ccode\u003ellms.txt\u003c/code\u003e file to your Hugo blog to make it more visible to AI agents and improve Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).","title":"How to add llms.txt to a Hugo Blog"},{"content":" UNSCRIPTEDLife, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Entrepreneurship\nAuthor: MJ DeMarco\nThis book felt so similar to The 4-Hour Work Week that I experienced deja-vu several times while reading it. In the end, I didn’t finish it. The tone of UNSCRIPTED is lighter than Tim Ferriss’s book (or maybe I’ve just grown used to the occasional swearing), but it was probably just bad timing to start this one so soon after finishing the other - the ideas and examples overlap quite a bit.\nThat said, I got the impression that DeMarco’s book is better structured and might be easier to follow overall.\nWhy read it? At some point in life, many of us realize that things aren’t going as smoothly as we hoped. You’re working hard, but still can’t afford a new car or a house that fits your family’s needs. Not talking about luxury - just something decent and new. You work 9-to-5, earn promotions and bonuses, and try to manage your career wisely, yet your financial situation barely improves. You start saving on holidays, but the \u0026ldquo;magic\u0026rdquo; of compound interest doesn’t seem to work for you. It’s a classic mid-life crisis scenario.\nYou can either accept it and keep \u0026ldquo;following the script\u0026rdquo; until the end - or, as DeMarco suggests, break free from it. His answer is straightforward: pursue entrepreneurship. Start your own business, because only by creating something that scales - where others’ work multiplies your impact - can you move beyond the limits of trading time for money.\nUNSCRIPTED can serve as a motivational push to take that leap. If you’ve already started wondering whether entrepreneurship might be worth a try, this book could give you both inspiration and some practical advice to get started.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2025/unscripted/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book UNSCRIPTED by MJ DeMarco\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eUNSCRIPTED\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eLife, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Entrepreneurship\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: MJ DeMarco\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis book felt so similar to \u003ca href=\"https://gagor.pro/book/2025/the-4-hour-work-week/\" \u003e\u003cem\u003eThe 4-Hour Work Week\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n that I experienced deja-vu several times while reading it.

For one of them, I\u0026rsquo;ve been preparing a presentation or rather a workshop, about \u0026ldquo;Motivation\u0026rdquo;.\nI wanted it to be a thought-provoking, workshop-style presentation where the title itself (\u0026ldquo;Why You should not motivate people\u0026rdquo;) challenges assumptions, and the session helps team leaders reflect on how they may (unintentionally) undermine intrinsic motivation. Idea behind this topic arrived after reading the \u0026ldquo;Drive\u0026rdquo; book by Daniel H. Pink .\nWriting this post was for me a preparation process, so I could refresh the key points and enhance with examples closer to my role.\nWorkshop Plan Duration: ~60–90 minutes.\nDepends on the engagement, can scale shorter if needed. Just keep an eye on the clock and skip questions.\nAudience: Team leaders, technical managers, IT focused.\nTone: conversational, reflective, not preachy.\nOutcome: Leaders leave with self-awareness and 1-2 practical commitments.\n1. Opening \u0026amp; Provocation (5–10 min) Slide/Title: \u0026ldquo;Why You Should Not Motivate People?\u0026rdquo; Pause, let people react. Ask: \u0026ldquo;What comes to your mind when you read this title?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What do you usually do when you feel your team lacks motivation?\u0026rdquo; Your prep/explanation:\nPeople expect leaders to \u0026ldquo;motivate.\u0026rdquo; The problem: most think of motivation as adding something (bonuses, speeches, pressure). Pink’s core message: people already have intrinsic motivation - we mostly need to stop blocking it.\n2. Traditional View of Motivation (10 min) Explain extrinsic motivation: \u0026ldquo;carrots and sticks\u0026rdquo; → rewards, bonuses, punishment, micromanagement. Share quick example: \u0026ldquo;If-then\u0026rdquo; rewards work for simple, mechanical tasks but backfire for complex, creative, problem-solving work (which is what we mostly do in tech). Use a quick poll or raise of hands: \u0026ldquo;Who here has offered a small incentive (bonus, position, gifts, other) to boost performance?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Did it create lasting motivation?\u0026rdquo; Prep/explanation:\nPink refers to \u0026ldquo;Motivation 1.0\u0026rdquo; as the basic instincts: fear, hunger, sex drive - those drive all the animals, including humans. As human beings we had to challenge them to build society. This where \u0026ldquo;Maslow\u0026rsquo;s hierarchy of needs\u0026rdquo;1 might ring a bell.\nWikipedia\nAlthough, as many later scientific researches proves - order is not necessarily like that, and many people\u0026rsquo;s behaviors just don\u0026rsquo;t fit to this schema.\nAccording to Drive, external motivators narrow focus, reduce creativity, and can kill intrinsic drive.\n3. What Science Shows (10–15 min) Slide/visual: Self-Determination Theory → Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose. Explain Pink’s three pillars: Autonomy – the urge to direct our own lives. Mastery – the desire to get better at something that matters. Purpose – the yearning to be part of something bigger. Interactive moment:\nAsk: \u0026ldquo;Think about a time you felt deeply motivated at work. Was it because of a bonus? Or because you had space, challenge, and meaning?\u0026rdquo; Let 2–3 participants share stories. Your prep/explanation:\nResearch by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan (founders of Self-Determination Theory) shows that when people experience autonomy, mastery, and purpose, they perform better, are more creative, and have higher well-being.\nDeci’s Soma Puzzle Experiment (1971)2: When participants were paid to solve puzzles, their interest dropped once the payments stopped-showing that external rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation. Lepper, Greene \u0026amp; Nisbett (1973)3: Children who were rewarded for drawing spent less time drawing later, compared to those who drew for fun. Meta-analyses4: Deci, Koestner \u0026amp; Ryan (1999) reviewed 128 studies and found that tangible rewards tend to decrease intrinsic motivation for interesting tasks. These findings are the scientific backbone for Pink’s argument: leaders should focus on creating environments that support autonomy, mastery, and purpose, rather than relying on external motivators.\n4. Turning the Lens on Leaders (20–25 min) Now guide reflection with open questions. You can split participants into small groups or just do it as an open discussion.\nFor Autonomy \u0026ldquo;How much decision-making power do I give my team?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Do I trust them enough to choose how to reach outcomes, or do I dictate the steps?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Do I measure success by presence/obedience, or by results and ownership?\u0026rdquo; For Mastery \u0026ldquo;Do I create space for people to learn and grow, even if it slows delivery?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Do I encourage experimentation, or do I punish mistakes?\u0026rdquo; For Purpose \u0026ldquo;Do my team members know why their work matters to the company and to customers?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;When I share goals, do I frame them as numbers to hit, or impact to make?\u0026rdquo; Your prep/explanation:\nThese are not rhetorical. Let people pause, reflect, maybe make notes. The goal is for them to feel a little uncomfortable in recognizing gaps.\n5. Practical Shifts Leaders Can Make (15–20 min) Offer concrete strategies:\nFor Autonomy:\nLet teams decide how to implement, not just what to deliver. Allow flexible work styles where possible. For Mastery:\nEncourage learning time, pair programming, innovation days. Celebrate progress, not just finished products. For Purpose:\nShare customer stories. Connect tasks to mission, not just metrics. Exercise idea:\n\u0026ldquo;Pick one pillar (autonomy, mastery, purpose). What’s one small change you could make next week in your team to strengthen it?\u0026rdquo; Have participants share in pairs or groups. 6. Additional materials I want to provide something, that everyone could try to use alone. I tried to present some flowcharts and decision trees that might help you, to address topic of motivation much easier.\nRecognizing motivation patterns Before trying to \u0026ldquo;motivate\u0026rdquo; someone, first recognize what type of motivation is currently at play. Each pattern calls for a different leadership reaction - and not all are about adding energy, sometimes it’s about removing friction.\nflowchart LR A[\"Observe team member's behavior\"] --\u003e B{\"What kind of motivation do you see?\"} B --\u003e C[Intrinsic Motivation] B --\u003e D[Extrinsic Motivation] B --\u003e E[Apathy / Disengagement] B --\u003e F[Stress-Driven Motivation] C --\u003e C1[\"Driven by curiosity or challenge\"] C --\u003e C2[\"Enjoys autonomy and mastery\"] C --\u003e C3[\"Feels connected to purpose\"] C --\u003e C4[\"✅ Leader action: Support autonomy, remove blockers, offer learning opportunities\"] D --\u003e D1[\"Motivated by rewards, recognition, or fear of loss\"] D --\u003e D2[\"Focuses on external validation\"] D --\u003e D3[\"⚠️ Leader action: Reconnect to purpose, shift focus from reward to meaning\"] E --\u003e E1[\"Low interest or energy\"] E --\u003e E2[\"‘Just doing the job’ attitude\"] E --\u003e E3[\"🚑 Leader action: Re-engage through ownership, connect work to personal impact\"] F --\u003e F1[\"Motivated mainly by fear or pressure\"] F --\u003e F2[\"Delivers short-term results, risks burnout\"] F --\u003e F3[\"💬 Leader action: Reduce pressure, build psychological safety and trust\"] Identify task type \u0026amp; response strategy This helps to decide if we should use incentives, autonomy, or structure depending on the task’s nature.\nDifferent kinds of work need different motivational strategies. For routine or operational work, structure and even small incentives can help. But for creative or problem-solving tasks - like most software work - autonomy and meaning drive performance more effectively.\nflowchart TD A[\"Task identified\"] --\u003e B{\"Type of work?\"} B --\u003e|Routine / Repetitive| C[\"Clearly defined steps \u0026 outcome\"] B --\u003e|Creative / Problem-Solving| D[\"Unclear path, requires insight\"] C --\u003e E[\"Focus on consistency \u0026 quality\"] C --\u003e F[\"OK to use clear metrics or small rewards\"] D --\u003e G[\"Focus on autonomy \u0026 exploration\"] D --\u003e H[\"Avoid controlling rewards\"] E --\u003e I[\"Support mastery via feedback loops\"] G --\u003e J[\"Provide purpose \u0026 trust\"] Risks of defining the wrong goals A clear, cautionary slide that ties everything back to leadership mistakes that kill motivation.\nMisaligned metrics Rewarding the number of commits instead of value delivered drives wrong behavior.\nOutput over Outcome People optimize for what’s measured - not necessarily what matters.\nShort-term focus Bonuses or targets can create tunnel vision and reduce learning or collaboration.\nCrowding out intrinsic motivation Overemphasis on KPIs or rewards signals: \u0026ldquo;We don’t trust your internal drive\u0026rdquo;.\nCulture impact When goals reward competition, not collaboration - trust and creativity drop.\nAs a leaders, we have to define goals that connect to purpose, support autonomy, and nurture mastery, rather than simply counting outputs.\n7. Closing \u0026amp; Reflection (5–10 min) Return to the title: \u0026ldquo;Why You Should NOT Motivate People?\u0026rdquo;\nWrap-up line:\n\u0026ldquo;Our role is not to motivate - it’s to create the conditions where motivation can thrive.

A central theme of the book is the importance of experimentation-minimizing upfront investment, reducing the startup costs of new initiatives, and then using metrics to monitor progress. Based on results, teams can decide whether to double down or abandon an idea in search of a better one.\nIt may sound straightforward, but in reality, things often get complicated when egos come into play-when managers focus more on proving themselves right than on achieving real results. That’s where this book proves especially valuable: it encourages readers to step back, look at their organization from a higher perspective, and reconsider whether the work being done is truly creating value.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re a Team, Tech Lead, or more Senior Engineer, I recommend it.

To grow, I need to put my ideas in front of the best professionals out there. That’s not easy anymore: Google and other search engines are shifting toward AI responses. Depending on the topic, this has cut organic traffic by up to 30% for big sites. For smaller blogs like mine, it’s even worse - search engines and AI prefer authoritative sources such as Wikipedia or government websites.\nSo how can I get some of that traffic back to my blog?\nSocial Media!\nI’ve already noticed that some of my articles spark more discussion outside my site - on Reddit\u0026thinsp; external link or Hacker News\u0026thinsp; external link .\nI’m not a heavy Reddit user though; there’s too much noise, and scrolling through it daily to catch 1 or 2 good threads doesn’t appeal to me. On the other hand, the Fediverse 1 feels like an exciting new world and a potential source of readers - though I could also live without constantly posting there.\nSo how can I stay active without wasting time manually pushing articles to every platform?\nThe answer is simple: I’m a DevOps. I know how to duct-tape and automate things \u0026#x1f609;.\nI found crosspost2, a tool that supports many social networks. It looked like a good start, but it lacked logic for pulling fresh posts from my blog.\nInspired by indexnow-action3 (which I already use), I built my own crosspost-action\u0026thinsp; external link 4. It’s mostly a wrapper around crosspost2, with added logic to fetch from a Sitemap or RSS/Atom feed, sort entries by freshness, and post them to configured social networks.\nThis way, I can publish new posts to my socials every day - automatically - without lifting a finger \u0026#x1f60e;.\nHow to set it up I use Hugo and GitHub Actions to publish my static site. To enable crossposting, I added a workflow file: .github/workflows/crosspost.yml.\nMy crosspost.yml name: Crosspost recent posts to Social Media on: # push will trigger dry-run only push: paths: - .github/workflows/crosspost.yml branches: - main schedule: - cron: \u0026#39;5 17 * * *\u0026#39; # every day at 17:05 UTC jobs: crosspost: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Run action-crosspost on my RSS feed uses: tgagor/action-crosspost@v1 with: dry-run: ${{ github.event_name != \u0026#39;schedule\u0026#39; }} feed-url: https://gagor.pro/index.xml # my RSS feed since: \u0026#39;1\u0026#39; since-unit: day mastodon-access-token: ${{ secrets.MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN }} mastodon-host: mastodon.social message: | New blog post: {url} #blog exclude-urls: | # ignore these https://gagor.pro/ https://gagor.pro/about/ You’ll need to define secrets for access tokens and API keys, then pass them into the action. Once configured, your posts will be published automatically.\nSitemap or RSS? At first, I thought the Sitemap would be the perfect source for fresh posts. But Sitemaps rely on the lastmod attribute, meaning that if I update an old post, it might be republished as “new.” That can spam social feeds and annoy followers.\nInstead, I switched to RSS, which uses the published date. This works much better and avoids reposting updated content.\nThe action also supports filters and exclusions, so you can easily fine-tune which URLs get posted.\nEnjoyed this post? https://jointhefediverse.net/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://github.com/humanwhocodes/crosspost\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://github.com/bojieyang/indexnow-action/tree/main\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://github.com/marketplace/actions/crosspost-action\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2025/09/crosspost-your-blog-articles-to-social-media/","summary":"Learn how to automatically share your latest blog posts to Mastodon, Twitter/X, and other social networks using GitHub Actions and the crosspost tool.

As repositories grow, they become harder to manage—builds take longer, pipelines get more complex, and you may find yourself fixing issues in parts of the codebase unrelated to your work just to get your build to pass.\nIf this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Eventually, the need arises to split a mono-repo. Having several smaller, focused repositories can simplify workflows and help teams take ownership of their code. But how do you do this without losing years of valuable history? Simply starting a new repo and ignoring the past isn’t ideal, and forking then deleting unrelated files leaves too much baggage. Is there a better way?\nLet’s walk through the process. Git is a powerful tool, and with the help of some scripts, you can split a mono-repo while preserving the history of specific files.\nRequirements You’ll need the git-filter-repo1 Python script. Install it with:\nInstall git-filter-repo brew install git-filter-repo # or pip3 install git-filter-repo Clone the original repository Start by cloning your original repository under a new name:\nClone your repository git clone ssh://git@github.com/my/repo.git new-beginning Disconnect from the old origin Switch to your new clone and remove the old remote:\nRemove old remote cd new-beginning git switch -c feature/separate-xyz git remote remove origin Filter history to keep only what You need List the files in your new repo:\nList files in repo ls -1 Decide which files you want to keep, then filter the history:\nFilter history and keep only selected files git filter-repo \\ --force \\ --path .gitattributes \\ --path .gitignore \\ --path .pre-commit-config.yaml \\ --path CHANGELOG.md \\ --path CONTRIBUTING.md \\ --path Makefile \\ # add other paths as needed Clean up unreferenced files and commits Run garbage collection to clean up:\nRun garbage collection git gc --aggressive Set Up a New Origin Create a new repository (if you haven’t already) and point your filtered repo to it:\nAdd new remote and switch to main git remote add origin ssh://git@github.com/my/new-beginning.git git switch -c main Warning\nDepending on your automation and pipelines, pushing changes may trigger jobs or require updates to paths and names. Double-check everything before pushing.\nIf you need, modify any pipelines or automation to prevent unintended builds or release.\nPush Your changes Push your changes to the new repository:\nPush changes to new repository git push -u origin HEAD:main git push --tags # If you need to overwrite history (be very careful!): git push --force Final Steps Commit any remaining changes, push, and verify that everything works as expected.\nFollowing this tutorial, you will end up with a new repo, with full history of changes in files that you listed and only those. It\u0026rsquo;s the cleanest way to achieve it, that I found.\n\u0026ldquo;The real takeaway: You don’t have to lose your project’s history or clutter your new repo with old baggage. With the right tools and a careful approach, you can split a mono-repo cleanly and keep your workflow efficient.\u0026rdquo;\nEnjoyed this post? https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2025/09/how-to-split-git-repository/","summary":"This guide explains how to split a mono-repo into smaller repositories, keeping the git history for selected files.","title":"How to split Git repository"},{"content":"Even when I read the title of this post, I ask myself: \u0026ldquo;Why would anyone want to do that?\u0026rdquo; \u0026#x1f923; Trust me, it’s more useful than you might expect.\nThe story is simple. I was evaluating a migration from one Docker Registry service (Artifactory\u0026thinsp; external link ) to another (Harbor\u0026thinsp; external link ). In theory, both work fine as Docker registries, but each has pros and cons (details don’t really matter here).\nSince I had both services available, I wanted to see if the new one could at least match-or hopefully outperform-the old one. I could have written a quick script to run a few pulls, but then I remembered a CLI tool: hyperfine1. I hadn’t really used it before, so I gave it a try. To my surprise, it turned out to be perfect for this task.\nRunning benchmarks Running Hyperfine hyperfine \\ --prepare \u0026#39;docker system prune -f -a\u0026#39; \\ --runs 5 \\ -L registry docker.io,quay.io/centos \\ \u0026#39;docker pull {registry}/centos:centos7\u0026#39; Here’s what’s happening:\n--prepare - runs before each benchmark to clear Docker caches, keeping results comparable. -L registry ... - defines variables so I can benchmark different values in one go. Killer feature! --runs 5 - runs each variant 5 times. docker ... - the actual command being tested. In this example, it runs two benchmarks (one for each registry) and compares the results. The output looks like this:\nHyperfine output Benchmark 1: docker pull docker.io/centos:centos7 Time (mean ± σ): 10.681 s ± 0.553 s [User: 0.029 s, System: 0.028 s] Range (min … max): 10.200 s … 11.443 s 4 runs Benchmark 2: docker pull quay.io/centos/centos:centos7 Time (mean ± σ): 11.102 s ± 0.753 s [User: 0.031 s, System: 0.029 s] Range (min … max): 10.201 s … 12.046 s 4 runs Summary docker pull docker.io/centos:centos7 ran 1.04 ± 0.09 times faster than docker pull quay.io/centos/centos:centos7 I used public registries here so you can copy/paste the command and try it yourself. In my real tests, of course, I used private registry URLs.\nYes, I know this isn’t a very scientific test. It mostly reflects network speed. Still, for a quick reality check, it was surprisingly useful. You can also run it from multiple machines to create higher load while still collecting results.\nOver the years I’ve written dozens of tiny benchmarking scripts for tasks like this. Thanks to hyperfine, I don’t need to anymore!\nEnjoyed? https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2025/08/benchmarking-docker-image-registries/","summary":"Learn how to benchmark Docker registry performance using the Hyperfine CLI tool.

My knowledge on the methodology came from \u0026ldquo;Getting to YES\u0026rdquo; book, but I found references to the methodology in many other books, like:\n\u0026ldquo;Psychologia szefa\u0026rdquo; (available only in Polish) \u0026ldquo;Why Should Anyone Be Led by You?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Collaborating with the Enemy\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Start with Why\u0026rdquo; This is not a thorough introduction to this methodology, more a raw memory dump, plus some notes.\nIntroduction “We all negotiate — in business, in families, in teams. But most people see negotiation as a battle of wills. The Harvard Negotiation Model offers a better way.”\nHave you ever \u0026ldquo;won\u0026rdquo; a negotiation but damaged the relationship?\nThe Harvard Model is about principled negotiation — reaching agreements without giving in and without creating enemies.\nCore Assumptions of the Harvard Model “The Harvard approach assumes negotiation is not a zero-sum game. It’s a process of joint problem-solving.”\nKey assumptions:\nNegotiation isn’t a battle — it’s a shared problem-solving process. Most conflicts come from hidden interests, not positions. You can be assertive without being adversarial. The 4 Principles of Principled Negotiation flowchart TD P1[\"Separate People from the Problem\"] P2[\"Focus on Interests, not Positions\"] P3[\"Invent Options for Mutual Gain\"] P4[\"Insist on Objective Criteria\"] P1c[\"Focus on the issue, not personalities.Emotions and relationships matter.\"]:::context P2c[\"Ask 'Why?' and 'Why not?' to uncover true motivations.\"]:::context P3c[\"Brainstorm multiple solutions before deciding.\"]:::context P4c[\"Use fairness, standards, data — not pressure.\"]:::context P1 --\u003e P2 P2 --\u003e P3 P3 --\u003e P4 P1 -.-\u003e P1c P2 -.-\u003e P2c P3 -.-\u003e P3c P4 -.-\u003e P4c classDef context fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#bbb,stroke-dasharray: 5 5,color:#333,font-style:italic; Quick example:\nTwo people fight over an orange. One wants the peel for baking, the other the juice. Splitting it 50/50 satisfies neither. But understanding interests leads to a smarter solution.\nSeparate people from problems. \u0026ldquo;Be hard on a problem, not on the people\u0026rdquo; Conflicts can be resolved without adversarial tactics - Try other\u0026rsquo;s side shoes. Focus on interests, not positions. Ask \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; a lot Negotiation is joint problem-solving, not a battle. Brainstorm separately, then together Make it easy for the other side to decide. Both sides can benefit - win-win outcomes are possible. Know Your BATNA Your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement is your safety net (or hidden super-power).\nBATNA is what you’ll do if no deal is reached. Example: If you’re negotiating a salary, another job offer is your BATNA. A strong BATNA improves your negotiation power (confidence + leverage). Don\u0026rsquo;t negotiate without knowing your BATNA - or theirs! Strong leaders don’t bluff. They know when to walk. What If They Play Dirty? Common tactics \u0026amp; Harvard responses\nStonewalling or refusing to negotiate? Reframe: Ask problem-solving questions like: \u0026ldquo;Why do you feel this won\u0026rsquo;t work?\u0026rdquo; Personal attacks? Stay calm, acknowledge emotions, redirect to the problem. Deceptive tricks? Expose the tactic politely: \u0026ldquo;Can we focus on facts and fairness?\u0026rdquo; Positional hard-bargainers? Use objective criteria - bring attention back to interests. Stay open even when it’s hard If pushed under the wall, change the rules of game. Quick Tips \u0026amp; Takeaways Prepare: Know your BATNA before entering. Listen more than you talk. Most people just wait to talk. Stay calm under pressure. Frame negotiation as joint problem-solving. Summarize and reframe to ensure common understanding, being on the same page. Use data, not pressure. One sentence summary:\n“Negotiation isn\u0026rsquo;t about defeating the other side; it\u0026rsquo;s about solving a problem together.”\nWrap-Up “The Harvard Model gives you tools to lead, solve, and connect — not to fight.”\n“In negotiation, you don’t get what you deserve — you get what you negotiate. But how you negotiate determines whether the outcome is a deal or a disaster.”\n“It’s not about being nice — it’s about being wise.”\nEnjoyed this post?

It\u0026rsquo;s easier to approach others for help or just relax between tasks with some jokes. But it\u0026rsquo;s hard to start if you don\u0026rsquo;t know others well enough. This might happen when a team has just formed or a new joiner feels alienated. One way to find similarities between people is to cultivate Personal Manuals. These are short descriptions of who you are, what you like (or don\u0026rsquo;t), and your preferred ways of working. They also reveal things you usually don\u0026rsquo;t ask about during daily meetings, like being a Sci-Fi fan or cheering for the same football team.\nHow to do it? You need a template that people can copy, paste, and fill out on their own. Save some time by sending it a few days before the meeting and asking everyone to arrive with it already filled in. There should still be some time to make updates and corrections during the meeting. It\u0026rsquo;s fine if people copy some topics from each other—that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what we\u0026rsquo;re looking for: similarities between strangers.\nWhen people are ready (and just that one person who arrived unprepared is still filling it out), you can start by encouraging everyone to present their manuals. If you have extroverts, they might want to go first—let them. Otherwise, be ready to lead the way as the team leader. It\u0026rsquo;s fine if people joke, ask questions, or interrupt. Just reserve enough time for that, and bring some snacks if the meeting might take longer.\nIt might not be obvious after the first or even the second person, but at some point you\u0026rsquo;ll start discovering connections, like:\n70% of people like the same music, they enjoy Sci-Fi movies, they do pole dancing or run ultra-marathons. After such sessions, the team discovers specialists in areas not directly related to work, but which help build stronger bonds and relationships. It\u0026rsquo;s just easier to work or align with people who think like you, do similar things, and this exercise helps make that happen.\nPersonal Manual Template Below is a refined template for a \u0026ldquo;Personal Manual.\u0026rdquo; Feel free to adapt or extend it.

Most people heard about Murphy\u0026rsquo;s Law, but there are many more that can be useful in corporate reality \u0026#x1f609;\nI will introduce my favorites in this post.\nKidlin\u0026rsquo;s Law Kidlin\u0026rsquo;s Law states,\n\u0026ldquo;If you can write the problem down clearly, then the matter is half solved.\u0026rdquo;\nThis law emphasizes the power of clear communication and problem definition. Often, the first step in solving any problem is to articulate it well. By writing down the problem, we can analyze it more effectively, identify the root causes, and brainstorm potential solutions.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nClarity in Objectives: Ensure that goals and problems are clearly documented in projects and tasks. Brainstorming Sessions: Encourage teams to write down issues before discussing them to foster structured thinking. Documentation: Maintain detailed records of problems and solutions for future reference. Gilbert\u0026rsquo;s Law Gilbert\u0026rsquo;s Law states,\n\u0026ldquo;The biggest problem at work is that nobody tells you what to do.\u0026rdquo;\nThis law underscores the importance of clear guidance and communication from leadership. In the absence of clear instructions, employees may feel lost, leading to inefficiency and frustration.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nClear Instructions: Managers should provide clear, concise instructions and expectations. Regular Check-Ins: Frequent meetings to ensure everyone understands their roles and responsibilities. Feedback Mechanisms: Create channels for employees to seek clarification and provide feedback. Wilson\u0026rsquo;s Law Wilson\u0026rsquo;s Law posits,\n\u0026ldquo;A good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow.\u0026rdquo;\nThis law highlights the value of timely action over delayed perfection. Waiting for a flawless plan can lead to missed opportunities and stagnation. It advocates for making the best possible decision with the information at hand and adjusting as needed.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nAgile Methodology: Implement iterative development and decision-making processes. Encourage Proactivity: Empower employees to take action and make decisions without fear of perfection. Review and Adapt: Regularly review plans and outcomes to make necessary adjustments. Falkland\u0026rsquo;s Law Falkland\u0026rsquo;s Law states,\n\u0026ldquo;When it is not necessary to make a decision, it is necessary not to make a decision.\u0026rdquo;\nThis law advises against making unnecessary decisions. Sometimes, the best course of action is to wait until more information is available or until the situation becomes clearer. Premature decisions can lead to unnecessary complications and stress.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nAssess Urgency: Determine whether a decision needs to be made immediately or if it can wait. Gather Information: Ensure all relevant data is available before making decisions. Avoid Overcommitment: Recognize when it\u0026rsquo;s appropriate to delay decisions to prevent rash actions. Murphy\u0026rsquo;s Law Murphy\u0026rsquo;s Law famously states1,\n\u0026ldquo;Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.\u0026rdquo;\nThis law humorously encapsulates the inevitability of errors and unforeseen problems in any situation. It serves as a reminder to prepare for the worst-case scenario and maintain flexibility and resilience.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nRisk Management: Identify potential risks and develop contingency plans. Prepare for Failures: Ensure backup systems and processes are in place. Maintain Flexibility: Be ready to adapt and respond to unexpected issues promptly. Conway\u0026rsquo;s Law Conway\u0026rsquo;s Law states2,\n\u0026ldquo;Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization\u0026rsquo;s communication structure.\u0026rdquo;\nThis law, formulated by Melvin Conway in 1967, suggests that the architecture of products and systems inevitably reflects the communication patterns and structure of the organization that creates them. In other words, if teams are divided in a certain way, the systems they build will mirror those divisions.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nOrganizational Design: Align team structures with desired system architecture to avoid unnecessary complexity. Cross-Team Collaboration: Foster communication across teams to encourage more integrated and cohesive system designs. System Refactoring: When reorganizing teams, review system architecture for potential improvements or simplifications. Metcalfe\u0026rsquo;s Law Metcalfe\u0026rsquo;s Law states3,\n\u0026ldquo;The value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its connected users.\u0026rdquo;\nProposed by Robert Metcalfe, this law highlights how the usefulness or value of a network (such as a social network or communication platform) increases dramatically as more users join. Each additional participant increases the number of possible connections, making the network exponentially more valuable.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nTeam Size Management: Recognize that as team size grows, the number of communication channels increases rapidly (for n people, there are n(n-1)/2 connections). When teams exceed 10–12 members, coordination and leadership become significantly more complex. To maintain efficiency and clarity, consider splitting large teams into smaller, more manageable groups. Network Effects: Encourage user growth to maximize the value of platforms and communities. Collaboration Tools: Promote adoption of shared tools to enhance communication and collaboration. Ecosystem Building: Foster partnerships and integrations to expand the reach and utility of products. Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s Law Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s Law states4,\n\u0026ldquo;Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\u0026rdquo;\nFirst articulated by Cyril Northcote Parkinson in 1955, this law observes that tasks often take as much time as you allow for them, regardless of their actual complexity. When more time is allocated than necessary, work tends to become unnecessarily complex or drawn out, leading to inefficiency and procrastination.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nSet Clear Deadlines: Assign realistic but firm deadlines to prevent tasks from dragging on. Timeboxing: Use timeboxing techniques to limit the amount of time spent on specific activities. Prioritization: Focus on delivering value quickly by breaking work into smaller, manageable pieces with short timelines. Avoid Overplanning: Resist the temptation to stretch simple tasks over long periods; encourage a results-oriented culture. Are these laws scientifically proven? These laws are largely anecdotal and based on observational wisdom rather than scientific rigor. They capture common experiences and insights in a memorable way but are not grounded in empirical research. Their value lies in their ability to highlight practical truths and guide behavior rather than in scientific validation.\n🟠 Kidlin\u0026rsquo;s Law: While not scientifically proven, it aligns with cognitive and psychological theories suggesting that problem definition is crucial for problem-solving. 🟢 Gilbert\u0026rsquo;s Law: Supported by management studies emphasizing the need for clear communication and guidance in organizations. 🟢 Wilson\u0026rsquo;s Law: Reflects principles found in agile methodologies and decision-making theories that favor timely action. 🟠 Falkland\u0026rsquo;s Law: Resonates with decision-making strategies that advise against premature decisions without sufficient information. 🔴 Murphy\u0026rsquo;s Law: More of a humorous axiom than a scientific principle, it underscores the importance of risk management. 🟢 Conway\u0026rsquo;s Law: Supported by empirical observations in software engineering and organizational studies, it highlights the impact of organizational structure on system design. 🟠 Metcalfe\u0026rsquo;s Law: Widely referenced in network theory and economics, it is supported by observations of network growth and value, though the exact proportionality is debated. 🟢 Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s Law: Supported by studies in behavioral economics and organizational psychology, it is widely observed in real-world work environments, though often cited as an empirical rule rather than a strict scientific law. Conclusion Some of those laws have serious, scientific background and can be used to strengthen your position in discussion, as it would be unreasonable to \u0026ldquo;doubt the science\u0026rdquo;.

He breaks things down step by step, challenging the default assumptions about work and life.\nHe defines the \u0026ldquo;New Rich\u0026rdquo; as people who have rediscovered what being rich actually means. Most people grind away day after day, chasing the \u0026ldquo;holy\u0026rdquo; retirement, only to find that when it finally arrives, they\u0026rsquo;re already too old or too tired to enjoy it. They work longer, harder, and more, just to justify not trying a different life. The \u0026ldquo;NR\u0026rdquo; (the New Rich, as he calls them) understand that being rich isn\u0026rsquo;t about having more stuff, but about having the freedom to choose what you do and when you do it. Ferriss suggests using geographical arbitrage-moving to cheaper places where you can live like the rich, often for surprisingly little money. He encourages you not to wait for retirement, but to start taking \u0026ldquo;mini retirements\u0026rdquo; right now, throughout your life.\nThis feels similar to the FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early), but even more radical. Tim shares his own experiences and techniques for achieving this lifestyle, and offers practical tools you can use to follow his approach. A lot of his advice centers on delegating everything possible to external agents in cheaper countries (like India). Some of the book\u0026rsquo;s examples are a bit dated-many old links are dead, and some advice (like selling DVDs) doesn\u0026rsquo;t really apply anymore. But there are still plenty of tips on how to start your first company, or how to test your product idea before you even have anything to sell. With today\u0026rsquo;s AI tools, some of his strategies could be pushed even further.\nFerriss also dives into mindset shifts: questioning why we accept the 9-5 grind as normal, and how to design a life that actually excites you. He talks about eliminating unnecessary work, automating what you can, and liberating yourself from the office-ideas that feel even more relevant in the remote-work era.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not saying I\u0026rsquo;ll follow everything he suggests, but the book definitely made me rethink a few things.

Zwieback contrasts fragile organizations - those that try to lock things down and prevent every possible failure - with antifragile ones, which use volatility, mistakes, and small shocks as opportunities to learn and improve.\nOne quotation that really stuck with me was Sidney Dekker’s: \u0026ldquo;What you call ‘root cause’ is simply the place where you stop looking any further.\u0026rdquo; It’s a perfect reminder that complex failures rarely come from a single source, and that stopping at the first \u0026ldquo;answer\u0026rdquo; is just another form of fragility. Another is the insight that \u0026ldquo;the single root cause of all outages - and all functioning - is impermanence\u0026rdquo;. Systems are always changing, and pretending otherwise just sets you up for surprise.\nI especially liked the observation about big organizations trying so hard to protect themselves from failures that they build layers of bureaucracy - until the bureaucracy itself becomes the problem. Zwieback’s alternative is the DevOps mindset, built on Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing (CAMS). These pillars encourage open communication, smarter tooling, actionable data, and transparency. The goal isn’t to eliminate failure, but to make sure that when failure happens, the system and the people involved come out stronger.\nThe book gives examples of companies like Netflix and Etsy that embrace this philosophy through practices such as chaos engineering and frequent, small deployments - creating an environment where change is constant and learning is continuous.\nIt’s not an in-depth manual, but it’s a clear, compact reminder that the path to resilience lies not in avoiding the storm, but in learning how to sail better because of it.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2025/antifragile-systems-and-teams/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book Antifragile Systems and Teams by Dave Zwieback\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eAntifragile Systems and Teams\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Dave Zwieback\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a short read, but it does a solid job of capturing an important idea: that the healthiest systems and teams aren’t just resistant to change, they actually get stronger through it.

To my surprise, much of the content felt familiar - not because I had read it before, but because I had already been using many of its principles, unknowingly picked up from other sources.\nFor example, Simon Sinek’s Start with Why isn’t a book about negotiation per se, but it emphasizes a key idea that aligns perfectly with the Harvard method: if you want to influence or persuade effectively, you must first deeply understand the issue - the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; behind the position.\nAnother book I read recently, Szef to zawód (translated roughly as Boss is a Profession), reinforces this idea even more explicitly. It advises not to negotiate based on fixed positions or demands. If an employee asks for a raise, you shouldn’t respond with a simple yes or no. Instead, you need to understand their perspective: Why are they asking now? How much do they need? What’s changed? Only when you uncover the underlying motivations and interests can you begin to find creative and satisfying solutions.\nOne of the most striking examples from Getting to Yes illustrates this beautifully. Two people both want the same orange. The \u0026ldquo;fair\u0026rdquo; solution might seem to be cutting it in half. But if you take the time to ask why each person wants it, you may find that one needs only the peel (for baking), and the other wants the pulp (to eat). The best solution becomes obvious - and both parties get 100% of what they truly need.\nThis is the essence of principled negotiation: don’t bargain over positions. Focus on interests, not demands.\nSummarizing the approach, it\u0026rsquo;s all about:\nSeparate the people from the problem\nEmotions, egos, and misunderstandings can derail a negotiation. Treat the other party as a partner, not an adversary.\nFocus on interests, not positions\nPositions are what people say they want. Interests are the reasons behind those wants. Dig deeper to uncover the \u0026ldquo;why.\u0026rdquo;\nInvent options for mutual gain\nDon’t settle for either/or thinking. Look for creative ways both sides can benefit.\nInsist on using objective criteria\nBase agreements on fair standards - market value, expert opinion, legal precedent - rather than pressure or power.\nI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t tell that I learned something absolutely new by reading the book, but I rather structured a technique I already used, and I can name better the stages of negotiation.

Do it at your own risk!\nIntel\u0026rsquo;s 14th generation of CPUs has faced criticism regarding energy efficiency and stability, with some reports suggesting issues with durability after a few months of usage. Intel has stated multiple times that these issues have been addressed\u0026hellip; Were they? 1\nThe CPU\u0026rsquo;s temperature can jump within a second to over 80°C for a single core and within 3-5 seconds for the entire package. Despite using AIO cooling, the CPU can still reach 87-90°C during Cinebench R23 tests. Single-core results are not significantly better. Each core operates at frequencies ranging from 800 MHz to 5300 MHz. I observed that when running processes utilizing 2-4 cores (not all cores), the scheduler frequently moves the workload between cores. Context switches are computationally expensive, and each time a process is moved, it lands on a less \u0026ldquo;stressed\u0026rdquo; core with a lower frequency, requiring time to ramp up. This results in temperatures rising to 60-70°C before the scheduler moves the workload again, ultimately degrading single-core performance. Another concerning behavior observed in CPU-Z is that, even when idle, the CPU voltage frequently spikes to 1.3V or higher, often reaching around 1.4V under light loads. This behavior appears unnecessary and resembles issues reported with i9 variants, where voltage spikes occur exactly during idle conditions.\nI first tried to overclock the CPU (just for sport), but the results were negligible, and the CPU was reaching 100°C in a moment. This is where undervolting came into play. I tried it and was surprised by the results:\nCPU reaching max 67°C, even during prolonged load. Fans silent all the time. Around 120W package load, with default limits set to 181W. Single core performance, around the same. Around 5% lower all core performance. Interestingly, in some scenarios, single-core workloads performed better than on default settings. For example, when running the SuperPI benchmark with 1M, it finished 1 second faster, and the 2M test completed 3–4 seconds faster! This improvement can be attributed to undervolting, which reduces thermal throttling and stabilizes core frequencies. By maintaining a stable frequency of 5.1–5.3 GHz, the CPU avoided frequent context switches caused by thermal spikes, allowing the workload to execute more efficiently without interruptions.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve got nice results with those settings:\nAI Tweaker: DIGI+ VRM: CPU Load-line Calibration -\u0026gt; [Level 4:Recommended for OC] Internal CPU Power Management: IA VA Voltage Limit -\u0026gt; [1300] Global Core SVID Voltage -\u0026gt; [Adaptive Mode] Offset Mode Sign -\u0026gt; [-] Offset Voltage -\u0026gt; [0.05] Cache SVID Voltage -\u0026gt; [Adaptive Mode] Offset Mode Sign -\u0026gt; [-] Offset Voltage -\u0026gt; [0.02] They run CPU in really cool temps, even when transcoding videos or running all core workloads. But with those settings CPU rarely reach 5.3 GHz on performance cores.\nI bumped IA VA Voltage Limit to 1350 and Global Core SVID Voltage to 0.07 to reach it. Now it can run at 5.3GHz. It works nice with silent setting for AIO. Only rarely I can hear soft tone of fans, but for that it require a long run under the load.\nNote\nHigher clocks does not necessarily mean more performance. In typical single/double-core workloads, CPU at 5.3GHz is getting warm quickly reaching ~70C. This usually triggers CPU scheduler to change the core to cooler one - causing a context switch\u0026thinsp; external link . This requires to copy cache and process memory to the space of another core and it makes the execution slower.\nOn lower voltage, CPU is cooler and despite it\u0026rsquo;s not reaching 5.3GHz, but rather keeps around 5.0~5.1GHz - it generally performs better. Under such conditions it rarely require to switch cores, so such workloads run faster. This applies to many single threaded benchmarks like SuperPI. Under multi-core workloads results are quite similar.\nHardware Installation Considerations This motherboard, like my previous one, has a quirk: the first NVMe socket (M.2_1) uses the CPU\u0026rsquo;s PCIe lanes. If you install your main drive there, it reduces the first PCIe slot\u0026rsquo;s bandwidth to 8x. To avoid this, I use the M.2_3 socket at the bottom, which utilizes chipset lanes and doesn\u0026rsquo;t throttle the GPU\u0026rsquo;s PCIe slot.\nEnjoyed this post? https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633446\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2025/04/asus-tuf-gaming-z790-plus-wifi-my-uefi-bios-settings/","summary":"Learn about the optimal UEFI BIOS settings for the Asus TUF Gaming Z790-Plus WIFI motherboard, including configurations for RAM, power management, virtualization, and more.","title":"Asus TUF Gaming Z790-Plus WIFI - My UEFI/BIOS Settings"},{"content":" Jak w kilku krokach Odnaleźć ZespółTrochę inna opowieść o przywództwie zespołowym\nAuthor: Piotr Jankowski\nI really enjoyed this book, despite it\u0026rsquo;s not widely known or even available to buy, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been working with it\u0026rsquo;s author, Piotr. I was participating few sessions/trainings with Piotr and reading this book was for me like I\u0026rsquo;ve heard him again next to me.\nPiotr Jankowski, executive coach and former managing director of Fujitsu Poland, in his book \u0026ldquo;Finding the Team\u0026rdquo; takes the reader through the personal and professional journey of a leader. Using the story of \u0026ldquo;Tomek\u0026rdquo; - an alter ego of many managers - he shows that true teamwork does not begin with processes, but with\u0026hellip; yourself.\nThe author emphasizes that before we find the team, we must find ourselves. A leader’s authenticity, awareness of values, and inner coherence are the foundation of effective leadership. Without that, every role - as a boss, parent, or partner - can turn into a \u0026ldquo;mask\u0026rdquo; that distances us from real influence on people.\nMain Takeaways from the Book Team ≠ Group - a group is just people, while a team is also the space between them: relationships, attitudes, dynamics. Trust as a foundation - it is the \u0026ldquo;oxygen of teamwork\u0026rdquo;. Without trust, the entire organizational structure collapses. Contracts and clear expectations - leaders should consciously \u0026ldquo;contract\u0026rdquo; goals, rules of cooperation, and boundaries of responsibility. Daily creation - teamwork is not one-off actions, but consistent relationship building, shared responsibility, and celebrating small wins. Change is inevitable - a mature leader accepts uncertainty and manages the team’s emotions during transitions. Agility - the key is flexibility and seeing change as an opportunity rather than a threat. Leadership posture - loyalty to the team, care-driven intent, humility, and balance between work and life are the hallmarks of mature leadership. I see is as a compilation of few other books, like: \u0026ldquo;The Five Dysfunctions of a Teams\u0026rdquo; , \u0026ldquo;Leadership and Self-Deception\u0026rdquo; , and probably few more, but thi one combines business practice, personal reflection, and coaching tools. Each chapter includes questions and exercises aimed at leaders and HR departments, making it not just a story but also a leadership development guide.\nI really enjoyed this book. I know Piotr, and for me reading it I could hear his voice next to me. In a world where much is said about results and KPIs, \u0026ldquo;Finding the Team\u0026rdquo; reminds us that true effectiveness starts with the human being.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2025/odnalezc-zespol/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book Jak w kilku krokach Odnaleźć Zespół by Piotr Jankowski\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eJak w kilku krokach Odnaleźć Zespół\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrochę inna opowieść o przywództwie zespołowym\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Piotr Jankowski\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI really enjoyed this book, despite it\u0026rsquo;s not widely known or even available to buy, but I\u0026rsquo;ve been working with it\u0026rsquo;s author, Piotr.

The first two chapters followed a familiar pattern—a brief introduction to a manager\u0026rsquo;s responsibilities followed by guidance on planning your approach. Then came the third chapter: Punishment! I was surprised the authors began with this topic rather than motivation or engagement.\nWritten by two Polish authors, this book is specifically designed for Polish managers leading Polish employees. Having previously read books focused on Agile practices and IT management for knowledge workers, I initially thought this more generic approach might not be applicable to my field. However, I was drawn in by the engaging writing style and found it enjoyable to read. The examples often present extreme situations followed by thoughtful analysis, offering a valuable perspective.\nThe book reminds me significantly of Effective Manager and its second edition , but with important adaptations for Polish work culture. For instance, the authors note that while Poles generally complain frequently, unlike in many other cultures, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily indicate negative attitudes. Rather, it might actually signal concern, commitment to proper task execution, or genuine engagement. The book also includes excellent references to Transactional Analysis as a foundation for communication, with examples of difficult conversations and strategies for handling them.\nIn summary, despite initially approaching it somewhat skeptically, I found this to be an excellent management book that incorporates plenty of humor. It serves as a solid instruction manual for new managers, while offering valuable insights even for those with more experience. Although it\u0026rsquo;s a good book, I would caution against applying its recommendations directly in multinational organizations without adaptation to diverse cultural contexts.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2025/psychologia-szefa/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book Psychologia szefa by Wojciech Haman, Jerzy Gut\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003ePsychologia szefa\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eSzef to zawód\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthors: Wojciech Haman,  Jerzy Gut\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve read many books about leadership, but none quite like this one.

Working in a company recently acquired by private equity funds, I see firsthand the same profit-maximizing tactics Jack Welch pioneered at General Electric. The relentless drive to squeeze margins, cut costs, and justify layoffs under the guise of efficiency feels eerily familiar. Having just survived my company’s first round of layoffs - an unprecedented event in our history - I can’t help but notice how our use of the vitality curve\u0026thinsp; external link mirrors the logic Welch popularized. What once seemed like a system for rewarding performance now feels like a mechanism priming us for workforce reductions.\nAt the same time, as an investor in the stock market, I recognize the other side of the equation. To an investor, a company’s internal struggles matter little; what truly matters is whether its stock price goes up or down. This book forced me to reconcile these two perspectives - the worker affected by corporate decisions and the investor who benefits from them. It also highlighted the perverse incentive\u0026thinsp; external link at play, where managers are disproportionately rewarded for aggressive cost-cutting, often at the long-term expense of the company and its employees. Being a lower-level manager myself, the book served as a cautionary tale - offering a glimpse into the type of leader I could become if I unquestioningly follow these principles.\nOne of the book’s greatest takeaways for me was the ability to recognize early warning signs of corporate restructuring and the potential consequences that follow. While I may not be able to change how private equity treats my company, at least I can anticipate and prepare for what’s coming. That’s why I believe this book should be required reading for any aspiring manager - it provides a sobering perspective on the broader system many of us operate within.\nThat said, while The Man Who Broke Capitalism is well-written and insightful, it is also quite one-sided. Gelles paints Welch as a near-demonic figure, responsible for many of the worst aspects of modern corporate America. While I agree that Welch’s influence was profound - and often damaging - the book lacks strong counterarguments or examples of alternative leadership approaches. In contrast, thinkers like Ken Blanchard advocate for more balanced, people-centric leadership styles, but these perspectives are largely absent from Gelles’ narrative.\nPerhaps the most eye-opening realization for me was understanding why so many investors prefer U.S. stocks. The ruthless, short-term-focused corporate strategies Welch championed are, in many ways, what enable the S\u0026amp;P 500 to maintain its impressive ~10% annual returns. This book also reshaped my view of celebrated investors like Warren Buffett. He is often glorified in financial media, but I hadn’t fully realized how much of his success comes from the same cost-cutting and profit-maximizing playbook that Welch helped institutionalize.\nUltimately, The Man Who Broke Capitalism is a thought-provoking read that challenged my views on corporate leadership, investing, and my own career trajectory. While it leans heavily into criticism of Welch, it provides an important lens through which to understand the forces shaping modern capitalism. Anyone working in management - or investing in the stock market - should read this book, if only to better understand the game they’re playing.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2025/the-man-who-broke-capitalism/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book The Man Who Broke Capitalism by David Gelles\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eThe Man Who Broke Capitalism\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow Jack Welch Gutted the Heartland and Crushed the Soul of Corporate America and How to Undo His Legacy\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: David Gelles\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Gelles’ \u003cem\u003eThe Man Who Broke Capitalism\u003c/em\u003e resonated with me on multiple levels, as both an employee and an investor.

I have been using Ubuntu for more than 15 years. In the past, I would jump to the newest releases to get the latest features. However, since few years, there haven\u0026rsquo;t been many changes I\u0026rsquo;ve been eagerly waiting for. So, I became lazy and instead of upgrading the OS twice a year, I prefer to stay with the LTS version and upgrade when a new one arrives and is well supported. Stability is now more important to me than being on the cutting edge.\nLTS versions are quite stable and well supported. Sometimes, when I need support for newer hardware, I upgrade to one of the latest variants.

While the past year was one of my best, I still underperformed compared to the broader market—meaning I didn’t make the most of the opportunities available. Some of my biggest mistakes included failing to set stop losses after dividend payouts, only to watch those stocks drop and leave me with unnecessary losses. I also lacked a solid exit strategy, often holding onto trades far longer than I should have.\nBulkowski’s Getting Started in Chart Patterns is all about technical analysis—a subject that’s often ridiculed, yet remains widely used. The reality is that human minds are wired to recognize patterns, and when thousands or even millions of traders are looking for the same signals, these patterns can influence market behavior. Bulkowski takes a statistical approach to analyzing popular chart patterns, explaining not just their structure but also how to use them effectively.\nOne of the most valuable takeaways for me was his method for calculating stop losses based on historical price variability. This approach helps place stop losses in a way that minimizes potential losses while avoiding being prematurely stopped out by normal market fluctuations. He also reinforced an important mindset shift: even if a single trade goes against me, there will always be another opportunity. The key is risk management—ensuring I have the capital to keep trading and investing.\nThanks to these insights, I’ve already exited most of my failing positions, keeping only the one that still shows potential. The capital I freed up has already started generating new profits.\nFor anyone looking to improve their technical trading skills with a data-driven approach, Getting Started in Chart Patterns is a solid resource that goes beyond theory and into practical application.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2025/getting-started-in-chart-patterns/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book Getting Started in Chart Patterns by Thomas N.

It’s not a traditional \u0026ldquo;how-to\u0026rdquo; guide packed with technical analysis or a magic formula for success. Instead, it’s an introspective journey of a trader, highlighting the mindset and discipline required to navigate the often unforgiving world of financial markets.\nThe book resonated with me at a critical moment in my investing journey. After a lackluster year in trading – one where my ETFs performed well, but poor decisions in Polish stocks hurt my overall performance – I needed a wake-up call. Hougaard’s emphasis on cutting losses early was a standout piece of advice. It’s a simple principle but one I neglected this year, allowing bad trades to linger instead of decisively closing them.\nWhile the book’s writing can be repetitive and sometimes underwhelming when it finally delivers on its teased promises, it compensates with authenticity. Hougaard doesn’t sugarcoat the challenges of trading or offer false hopes. Instead, he advocates for mental fortitude, embracing losses as part of the process, and letting go of the ego that often leads to holding onto losing positions.\nFor me, as someone who identifies more as an investor than a trader, some of his strategies don’t directly apply. However, the core lesson – discipline over emotions – is universal. This isn’t a book about becoming a millionaire overnight - it’s about developing the resilience to survive and thrive in the markets.\nIf you’re looking for a motivational push or a reality check, Best Loser Wins delivers, albeit imperfectly. It might not teach you the mechanics of trading, but it will make you rethink how you approach it.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2025/best-loser-wins/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book Best Loser Wins by Tom Hougaard\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eBest Loser Wins\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy Normal Thinking Never Wins the Trading Game - Written by a High-Stake Day Trader\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Tom Hougaard\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTom Hougaard’s \u0026ldquo;Best Loser Wins\u0026rdquo; offers a refreshingly honest look at the realities of trading.

Dockerfiles revolutionized the industry with their simplicity. Each instruction creates a new layer in the image, which is automatically cached. This process integrates well with SCM, where you \u0026ldquo;commit\u0026rdquo; the results of one stage and move forward with other changes. The process can be easily parameterized with ARG instructions, similar to ENV but provided during the build. This allows for creating highly flexible builds. For most users, this is more than sufficient. However, there\u0026rsquo;s a notable exception: Docker base images.\nWhether you\u0026rsquo;re working on public base images or preparing bases for your enterprise, they differ from typical app images. App images rely on bases to deploy your single app with consistent quality, stable builds, and no surprises from breaking changes in the base images. Typically, you select the runtime version you need, for example, Tomcat 10.1.34, and then use the Docker image tomcat:10.1.34-jdk21. If you\u0026rsquo;re brave, you might choose tomcat:10.1-jdk21, which provides some Tomcat upgrades, or even tomcat:10-jdk21. Currently, Tomcat supports three major versions: 9, 10, and 11. Your apps might use any of them and they all have to be provided with stable and secure dependencies. Check Docker Hub page for the Tomcat image\u0026thinsp; external link to see how many of tags they have to provide for people\u0026rsquo;s convenience.\nFrom the perspective of someone responsible for base images, how can you support this? Tomcat upgrades are owned by development teams because they might need to upgrade dependent libraries or configurations. But maintaining a stable and patched base image is usually the responsibility of an infra/SRE team. Keeping \u0026ldquo;the platform\u0026rdquo; patched and stable might require updating OS packages in images, even if developers don\u0026rsquo;t pay attention to that process. If the Dev team stays on an older version of Tomcat, that\u0026rsquo;s their risk, but if you keep images with unpatched openssl, it becomes \u0026ldquo;a platform problem\u0026rdquo;. Directives like NIS21 make enterprises accountable for not keeping the application stack updated, but upgrades of Docker images are tricky because you might need to support:\nDifferent OS, like Ubuntu and Alpine, Different Tomcat versions, Different Java versions, Configuration differences, Different package names, etc. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you support 2 different Ubuntu versions + 1 Alpine, up to 3 versions of Tomcat on 3 LTS versions of Java, resulting in (2+1)*3*3 -\u0026gt; 27 combinations. Supporting up to 5 versions of Tomcat results in 45 combinations. It\u0026rsquo;s growing exponentially!\ngraph LR A(tomcat) --\u003e T9(9) T9 --\u003e J11(Java 11) T9 --\u003e J17(Java 17) T9 --\u003e J21(Java 21) J11 --\u003e U1(Ubuntu 24.04) J11 --\u003e U2(Ubuntu 22.04) J11 --\u003e A1(Alpine 3.21) J17 --\u003e U1 J17 --\u003e U2 J17 --\u003e A1 J21 --\u003e U1 J21 --\u003e U2 J21 --\u003e A1 A --\u003e T10(10) T10 --\u003e J11(Java 11) T10 --\u003e J17(Java 17) T10 --\u003e J21(Java 21) A --\u003e T11(11) T11 --\u003e J11(Java 11) T11 --\u003e J17(Java 17) T11 --\u003e J21(Java 21) In a large enterprise, you\u0026rsquo;re not only working with Tomcat. There will be various Java versions, some legacy but still required for old systems. And more: JBoss, multiple Python versions, Apache or Nginx, Redis, NoSQL DBs, PostgreSQL from version 10 to 16. All requiring support on 2-3 different operating systems. The number of combinations is overwhelming!\nSome questions should already arise in your head\u0026hellip;\nHow can We do it better? In organizations big enough, you need a central process to manage upgrades. You need to prove that you at least tried to keep everything updated. That\u0026rsquo;s why it might make sense to manage your own base images, which you can control and manage security upgrades at your own pace, with known rules in the organization . We know what we have to do, but how to do it?\nStandard tools provide a lot of convenience to parameterize builds, so you might start wrapping some shell scripts to use them. At some point, you will realize that without parallel builds, it would take hours to finish, so you make your scripts even more complicated. I used Makefiles for that . Then you will face small differences between tools or OS versions - sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s a package name, other times it\u0026rsquo;s a file location. You have to keep those differences somewhere and start adding more directories, copying files back and forth, making it easy to make a typo or mistake. Just take a look at official Corretto images\u0026thinsp; external link - there are directories, with sub-directories, with sub\u0026hellip; To manage all the quirks.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when you start thinking:\nIf I could just template this and that, I\u0026rsquo;d have just two files and the rest could be autogenerated.\nBut building such a templating system is not easy, and that\u0026rsquo;s where I reached too. I needed a tool that would allow me to easily declare what I want to build, and then execute it simply. I want to make the whole tagging process easy, and I use labels on images too, so I wanted them supported as well.\nI found this one article\u0026thinsp; external link but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t happy with the tool. It was too complicated and gluing things together felt odd. I knew I could do better.\nMy idea was inspired by Ansible playbooks. Simple YAML, easy to write, easy to read and understand, with structure that describe itself. Ansible relies on Jinja22 and as I started writing my tool in Python, I used it too. But most of my friends, including myself, got used to GoLang templates - used for Helm charts templating and widely around Docker tools. I decided it\u0026rsquo;s time to learn GoLang (how hard could it be, right?) and switch templating language. That\u0026rsquo;s how template-dockerfiles\u0026thinsp; external link (or td\u0026thinsp; external link in short) tool started: .\nKey features:\nSimple YAML config defining what to build and how. Dockerfiles templating when needed (GoLang templates + Sprig functions3). Tags or versions templated the same way. Labels (I use OCI Label Schema heavily) templated the same way. Easy parallel builds when possible. Easy to integrate with CI/CD, allowing to just generate templates or build and push completely - whatever you prefer. Why templating is better? At some scale, copying and pasting files and scripts, despite being a simple task, can be error-prone due to the number of changes you have to perform. This increases the probability of mistakes or typos. I\u0026rsquo;ve made mistakes like that, they passed review by my teammates and went to production because there were just a lot of similar changes and it was hard to spot one outlier.\nWorking with templates has the benefit that you define a general rule by which templates will be generated. Over time, you might add a few exceptions or additional steps required for specific versions. When you generate images from templates, they follow the rules strictly, and if you make a small mistake in the definition, it will propagate to multiple images, causing a blast impact. We can say that either you succeed or fail spectacularly \u0026#x1f923;\nWorking with templates is more like coding. It requires a higher level of focus and by that, it\u0026rsquo;s less prone to making a mistake that would apply to just one version. On the other hand, copying and pasting the same change across multiple files or directories is a dumb task, which we\u0026rsquo;re doing on auto-pilot, and it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to make a silly mistake.\nEnough talking about the reasons. Let me go through some examples.\nTemplating Dockerfiles Examples In general, my tool requires:\nConfiguration file. Bunch of Docker files. You can structure them as you want as long as the configuration is aligned with your directory structure.\nExample 1: Simple Configuration, no templating Let start with something simple, like preparing a generic base image. You save this in your build.yaml file (or whatever you would provide to --config flag).\nDefine your config file: build.yaml images: base: dockerfile: base/Dockerfile variables: alpine: - \u0026#34;3.18\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;3.19\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;3.20\u0026#34; args: BASEIMAGE: alpine:{{ .alpine }} tags: - base:{{ .tag }}-alpine{{ .alpine }} - base:{{ .tag }}-alpine{{ .alpine | splitList \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; | first }} - base:alpine{{ .alpine | splitList \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; | first }} - base:{{ .tag }} Fields Description images: The root key for defining different images. base: The name of the image. Name it as dockerfile: The path to the Dockerfile or Dockerfile template (.tpl extension). variables: Variables to be used in the template. alpine: A variable which represents list of Alpine versions. args: Arguments that will be passed as --build-arg, during the image build. tags: The tags to be applied to the generated images, plus templated values. {{ .tag }} : Is a value provided to --tag parameter, usually a version of your image. Let choose really basic, base image: base/Dockerfile ARG BASEIMAGE FROM ${BASEIMAGE} CMD [\u0026#34;echo\u0026#34;] Assuming you already installed the tool\u0026thinsp; external link , let generate templates by calling:\nBuild images td --config build.yaml --tag 1.0.0 --build It\u0026rsquo;s a simple config file but there\u0026rsquo;s already a lot happening there. It will produce 5 Docker images, one per each Alpine version and will tag them according to the rules. Thanks to that we already have multiple patterns, from which your developers can choose\nBuilt images $ docker image ls REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE base 1.0.0 bb5fa559eff4 3 months ago 12.1MB base 1.0.0-alpine3 bb5fa559eff4 3 months ago 12.1MB base 1.0.0-alpine3.20 bb5fa559eff4 3 months ago 12.1MB base 1.0.0-alpine3.19 5e664aff1066 3 months ago 11.5MB base 1.0.0-alpine3.18 87b441f4c072 3 months ago 11.5MB If you would like to introduce just released Alpine 3.21\u0026thinsp; external link , it\u0026rsquo;s just one line more in the config file.\nExample 2: Simple configuration with templating We went through simplest example, so it\u0026rsquo;s time to rise the bar. We will use Dockerfile.tpl now and we don\u0026rsquo;t need args anymore. We will also introduce Alpine 3.21, which for some reason would require to do something differently than other versions. We will also add one more tag, to simplify referring to specific Alpine\u0026rsquo;s version. Final config will be:\nDefine your config file: build.yaml images: base: dockerfile: base/Dockerfile.tpl variables: alpine: - \u0026#34;3.18\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;3.19\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;3.20\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;3.21\u0026#34; tags: - base:{{ .tag }}-alpine{{ .alpine }} - base:alpine{{ .alpine }} - base:{{ .tag }}-alpine{{ .alpine | splitList \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; | first }} - base:alpine{{ .alpine | splitList \u0026#34;.\u0026#34; | first }} - base:{{ .tag }} Our template is just slightly different as it have to \u0026ldquo;react\u0026rdquo; to this \u0026ldquo;breaking change\u0026rdquo; in Alpine 3.21. It would be easy to use bash conditions to react to different Alpine version in RUN directives, but it\u0026rsquo;s not easy to do the same for CMD - at least, not without custom entrypoint. As Go-Lang templates, provide us conditions and loops, we can do really crazy things in those templates, but please - don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026#x1f609;.\nbase/Dockerfile.tpl FROM alpine:{{ .alpine }} {{ if eq .alpine \u0026#34;3.21\u0026#34; }} CMD echo this is alpine 3.21 specific {{ else }} CMD echo this is generic {{ end }} Build command stays the same, but we will bump a minor version4: Build images td --config build.yaml --tag 1.1.0 --build And the result will be:\nResult images $ docker image ls REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE base alpine3.18 c46557602bb4 30 minutes ago 11.5MB base v1.1.0-alpine3.18 c46557602bb4 30 minutes ago 11.5MB base alpine3.19 ecc2bc3541fe 30 minutes ago 11.5MB base v1.1.0-alpine3.19 ecc2bc3541fe 30 minutes ago 11.5MB base alpine3.20 0319369f1076 30 minutes ago 12.1MB base v1.1.0-alpine3.20 0319369f1076 30 minutes ago 12.1MB base alpine3 9d78f7b4ccac 30 minutes ago 12.2MB base alpine3.21 9d78f7b4ccac 30 minutes ago 12.2MB base v1.1.0 9d78f7b4ccac 30 minutes ago 12.2MB base v1.1.0-alpine3 9d78f7b4ccac 30 minutes ago 12.2MB base v1.1.0-alpine3.21 9d78f7b4ccac 30 minutes ago 12.2MB Let test the result:\n~/2025/01/efficient-dockerfile-templating-for-complex-build-scenarios/ $ docker run -ti --rm base:alpine3.18 this is generic $ docker run -ti --rm base:alpine3.21 this is alpine 3.21 specific Let check again what happen here. With quite the same configuration and a template of Dockerfile we\u0026rsquo;ve been able to generate 4 different images (1 per Alpine\u0026rsquo;s version), with 11 tags just to make the choice for people easier. Tags are generated in order, and variable\u0026rsquo;s values are also ordered so latest version of Alpine (listed as last one) is the new default.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really clean and easy to follow, what happens here, which would be even more important in the next example \u0026#x1f609;\nExample 3: Complex Configuration I used Tomcat as an example earlier and this will be our next example.

I won\u0026rsquo;t be showing Dockerfiles here, as the main actor here is configuration. It would be extremely hard to follow such structure with all those variations with bash scripts or Makefiles. It\u0026rsquo;s around 100 lines of configuration, easy to read and understand that will produce tens of image variants, that can be used by your developers in a way they need. Templating abilities on tags, args or labels allow to dynamically describe our images.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the final I wanted to achieve. Simple recipe to deliver complex build strategies for Docker images.\nMore Examples I will try to update and curate a list of good examples of td usage in the wild. For now, it\u0026rsquo;s mostly mine stuff:\nhttps://github.com/tgagor/docker-centos\u0026thinsp; external link Weekly updated CentOS Stream images. td for building, Github actions\u0026thinsp; external link for versioning, security scans.

It allows to \u0026ldquo;cut\u0026rdquo; minimal versions of Docker images by extracting only binary dependencies required to run our app. It allows to compete with Alpine\u0026rsquo;s images on size, but with standard glibc.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a complete, multi-platform build with Github actions for automatic builds!\nWhat more you can do?

While it does delve into the dynamics of how crowds think and act, it focuses more on describing their irrationality and susceptibility to influence rather than offering practical insights on managing or guiding them.\nLe Bon explains that when individuals form a crowd, their intelligence diminishes, and their reactions become exaggerated. Logical arguments lose their power in this setting, replaced by myths, emotions, and impulsive behaviors. This explanation has value, particularly for understanding the tools politicians and demagogues often use to manipulate public opinion – fear, irrational narratives, and appeals to emotion rather than reason.\nHowever, I found the book lacking in actionable advice. My hope was for more concrete strategies on engaging or managing crowds, but the text remains primarily theoretical. While it sheds light on the crowd’s nature, it doesn’t equip the reader with methods to navigate or influence it effectively.\nThat said, the book’s insights into the vulnerabilities of collective thought could still prove useful, especially for those looking to understand the manipulative tactics often employed in politics or social movements. For readers seeking a more hands-on guide, though, this may feel like a missed opportunity.\nIn the end, The Crowd is an interesting historical work that outlines the mechanics of collective psychology, but its relevance and practicality are limited - at least, unless you\u0026rsquo;re politician.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2024/the-crowd/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book The Crowd by Gustave Le Bon\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eThe Crowd\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Study of the Popular Mind\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Gustave Le Bon\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGustave Le Bon’s \u0026ldquo;The Crowd - A Study of the Popular Mind\u0026rdquo; is often hailed as a classic exploration of crowd psychology, but for me, it fell short of expectations.

However, you may occasionally encounter the error \u0026ldquo;Cannot rebase onto multiple branches\u0026rdquo;. This article explains why this happens and provides a solution to make git pull --rebase work seamlessly.\nBenefits of git pull --rebase Linear History: Rebasing applies your local commits on top of the upstream changes, creating a straight line of commits without unnecessary merge commits. This makes the project history easier to read and understand.\nNo Merge Commits: Regular merges create additional merge commits, which can clutter the commit history, especially if frequent pulls are necessary. Rebase avoids these extra commits.\nSingle Conflict Resolution: With rebase, you only resolve conflicts once. When merging, conflicts can arise multiple times if multiple merges happen, but with rebase, each commit is reapplied one at a time on top of the upstream changes, and conflicts are resolved in the context of the latest code.\nTo use rebasing by default, add this to your ~/.gitconfig:\n~/.gitconfig [pull] rebase = true This is equivalent to adding the --rebase flag to each pull. However, this approach occasionally fails with the error \u0026ldquo;Cannot rebase onto multiple branches\u0026rdquo;, which is quite irritating because running git pull a second time usually works. This error occurs because multiple branches are available, and Git doesn\u0026rsquo;t know which one to rebase onto, even if you\u0026rsquo;re on the master branch (as that\u0026rsquo;s the branch I pull from most frequently).\nSolution: Specify the Branch to Rebase Onto Instead of relying on keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+r, you can configure Git to always pull from the specific branch by default. This ensures that git pull --rebase works as expected every time.\nAdd these parameters on a per-branch basis in your ~/.gitconfig file:\n~/.gitconfig [branch \u0026#34;master\u0026#34;] remote = origin merge = refs/heads/master [branch \u0026#34;main\u0026#34;] remote = origin merge = refs/heads/main This configuration applies to both master and main branches, whatever you prefer; just copy and paste the config for it.\nSolution 2: If you use Oh-My-Zsh and git-auto-fetch plugin I found that git-auto-fetch plugin runs fetches in parallel (as expected), but this results often in the same error - especially when I enter to my repo dir and just fire git pull.\nI had to remove it from plugins line in my ~/.zshrc.\nEnjoyed?

In this work, Schopenhauer outlines 38 stratagems for convincing opponents and prevailing in debates, often irrespective of the truth. His analysis is rooted in the belief that people are more interested in winning arguments than seeking truth.\nThe central outcome of Schopenhauer\u0026rsquo;s work is the detailed exposition of tactics people use to win arguments, revealing how rhetorical techniques can manipulate and dominate discussions. Schopenhauer’s focus is not on ethical or logical correctness but rather on the effectiveness of these tactics in persuading others and securing victory in debates.\nConfronting the Present Approach to Negotiation Principled Negotiation: Modern negotiation often emphasizes principled negotiation, as outlined by Roger Fisher and William Ury in their book \u0026ldquo;Getting to Yes.\u0026rdquo; This approach focuses on finding mutually beneficial solutions, separating people from the problem, and focusing on interests rather than positions. Win-Win Solutions: The current trend in negotiation is to seek win-win outcomes where all parties feel their needs and interests are addressed. Ethics and Integrity: Ethical considerations and integrity play a crucial role in contemporary negotiation practices, promoting honesty, transparency, and fairness. Does Schopenhauer\u0026rsquo;s Approach Still Work? Effectiveness:\nSchopenhauer\u0026rsquo;s tactics can still be effective in certain scenarios, particularly in competitive environments where winning the argument is paramount, and the focus is more on persuasion than on finding a mutual agreement. Techniques such as appealing to emotion, distracting the opponent, or using reductio ad absurdum can influence audiences and can be seen in political debates, legal battles, and competitive business negotiations. Limitations:\nEthical Concerns: Schopenhauer’s approach often conflicts with the ethical standards of modern negotiation. Manipulative and deceptive tactics can damage reputations and relationships, leading to long-term negative consequences. Collaborative Environments: In collaborative environments, such tactics can be counterproductive. Building trust and fostering cooperation are crucial for successful long-term relationships, which Schopenhauer\u0026rsquo;s strategies may undermine. Focus on Interests: Modern negotiation’s emphasis on addressing underlying interests rather than surface positions can lead to more sustainable and satisfactory outcomes for all parties involved, a goal Schopenhauer\u0026rsquo;s strategies may not support. Conclusion While Schopenhauer’s \u0026ldquo;The Art of Being Right\u0026rdquo; provides insightful and sometimes amusing strategies for winning arguments, these techniques are often at odds with contemporary negotiation practices that prioritize ethical behavior, collaboration, and mutual benefit. While his methods might still work in specific adversarial contexts, they are generally less effective and desirable in negotiations aiming for long-term, ethical, and mutually advantageous outcomes.\nFor me it\u0026rsquo;s valuable to be able to identify, if anyone would like to use such tactics on me, rather that to use them on my own.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2024/the-art-of-being-right/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book The Art of Being Right by Artur Schopenhauer\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eThe Art of Being Right\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003e38 Ways to Win an Argument\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Artur Schopenhauer\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Art of Being Right\u0026rdquo; by Arthur Schopenhauer is an interesting exploration of rhetoric and the art of winning arguments.

Adding lastmod should help, but together with each new post added, Hugo generates a ton of taxonomy pages (tags, categories, etc) which also would have lastmod updated. Taxonomy pages might catch some traffic eventually, but nowadays they\u0026rsquo;re mostly useful for humans, when they\u0026rsquo;re looking for similar content. Search engines rather forward people directly to the content.\nInitially I was thinking about excluding from crawl taxonomy pages, for example:\ntags/* categories/* paginated pages like */page/1 This for sure would allow Google to focus mostly on the pages with content, but as pages won\u0026rsquo;t be removed from Sitemap, they would pollute it and I would be left with a ton of errors in Google\u0026rsquo;s Search Console\u0026thinsp; external link . Not nice. I was also thinking about using meta robots tag set to \u0026ldquo;noindex, follow\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026lt;meta name=robots content=\u0026#34;noindex, follow\u0026#34;\u0026gt; which theoretically should ignore some of the pages, but would allow Google to discover the linking structure and importance of specific URLs. But it looks like it\u0026rsquo;s no longer a valid assumption, at least for Google. I don\u0026rsquo;t know about the others like Bing/Yandex/Baidu. I have some percentage of the traffic generated by other search engines so I don\u0026rsquo;t want to \u0026ldquo;piss them off\u0026rdquo;.\nI started looking for options to exclude tags and categories from the sitemap generation process and I found accidentally something else: cascade param in front-matter2. Which combined with the sitemap override3 pointed me into another direction: maybe I could just setup priority + changefreq for specific page categories and it would do the trick. For more details check Sitemap protocol docs4.\nBy default, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s sitemap layout produces quite basic sitemap without any priorities set. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t guide Google well on which page should be crawled first. Let chase this idea.\nI crated a dir and file tags/_index.md to match my taxonomy preference. In the file I\u0026rsquo;ve added:\n--- title: Tags cascade: params: sitemap: # disable: true changefreq: weekly priority: 0.1 --- There is option to disable at all, but tags can actually route some traffic to my site, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it. I changed frequency and set priority to lowest possible.\nWarning\nThat\u0026rsquo;s intriguing, but it\u0026rsquo;s really important to remember about the title here! When we add custom tags/_index.md, it overwrites defaults and title could evaluate to empty string, which in my case broke the breadcrumbs and resulted in Google\u0026rsquo;s Search Console to report critical issues!\nI followed same pattern for categories/_index.md but with priority: 0.2 as I have less categories and they feel more important to me.\nThen time came for posts/_index.md with priority: 0.9 and posts/2024/_index.md with priority: 1.0. Posts are the core of my blog, so I gave them highest priority and even higher for the recent ones. To finalize it, I added few changefreq here and there too, based on my gut feeling.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s more or less what was the final result:\ngraph LR root[\"/\"] --\u003e posts[\"/posts\"] posts --\u003e older[\"/...\"] older --\u003e older_sitemap[\"priority: 0.9\"] posts --\u003e 2023[\"/2023\"] 2023 --\u003e older_sitemap posts --\u003e 2024[\"/2024\"] 2024 --\u003e newer_sitemap[\"changefreq: weekly, priority: 1.0\"] root --\u003e books[\"/books\"] books --\u003e book_sitemap[\"changefreq: monthly, priority: 0.6\"] root --\u003e tags[\"/tags\"] tags --\u003e tags_sitemap[\"changefreq: weekly, priority: 0.1\"] root --\u003e categories[\"/categories\"] categories --\u003e categories_sitemap[\"changefreq: weekly, priority: 0.2\"] root --\u003e authors[\"/authors\"] authors --\u003e authors_sitemap[\"changefreq: yearly, priority: 0.1\"] This should prioritize crawling of freshly created content over automatically generated pages.

Whole D\u0026amp;D physics of the world was quite complex, but game on it\u0026rsquo;s own was straightforward. Of course, first game you played with sub-optimal characters, then you learn and play again. Character development trees were simple - despite the weapon specialization, there was not much you could influence. Creators were playing by adding fragments of non-linearity on few quests, something quite unusual in the world where most games were linear.\nI remember that the strongest opponents were dragons, so I tried to defeat all of them, which can be clearly seen on the screenshots.\nIce Wind Dale I played Ice Wind a lot, but I have only one screen from it.

However, as a service provider, Amazon must support older systems as long as there are customers willing to pay for them.\nIn December 2023, Amazon announced1 plans to upgrade legacy RDS instances to versions still under active development, citing the rising costs of maintaining outdated systems. This included versions like MySQL 5.7 and PostgreSQL 10 (or earlier)2. However, instead of enforcing upgrades, Amazon introduced a new support approach: RDS Extended Support. This allows customers to continue using older versions, but with additional costs.\nRDS Extended Support provides more time for users to upgrade to supported major engine versions while still receiving critical updates and support. For instance, support for MySQL 5.7 in RDS ends on February 29, 2024. Databases that do not upgrade by this date will be automatically enrolled in RDS Extended Support starting March 1, 2024, and will incur additional charges. This support is available for up to three years past the end-of-support date3.\nThe additional costs vary by region and can be significant, especially for large instances with many vCPUs. I was really interested how much it will cost?\nBelow is a table detailing the rise in costs per month per core by region:\nRise of Cost per Month/Per Core by Region Region 1st year 2nd year 3rd year US West (Oregon) $72.00 $72.00 $144.00 US West (N. California) $80.64 $80.64 $161.28 US West (Los Angeles) $86.40 $86.40 $172.80 US East (Ohio) $72.00 $72.00 $144.00 US East (N.

My RDS instance have usually between 2~8 cores - that\u0026rsquo;s a lot of money burned!\nFrankfurt I run a lot of workloads here - costs in Europe are just higher \u0026#x1f610;\nFinal words This extended support strategy allows Amazon to manage the high costs of maintaining legacy systems while providing customers with the flexibility to plan their upgrades without immediate disruption. However, the cost can add up, especially for large, resource-intensive instances. I already planned upgrading mine.\nEnjoyed? https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/your-mysql-5-7-and-postgresql-11-databases-will-be-automatically-enrolled-into-amazon-rds-extended-support/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/PostgreSQLReleaseNotes/postgresql-release-calendar.html\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/estimating-the-charges-for-amazon-rds-extended-support/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2024/04/rising-costs-of-running-legacy-amazon-rds-systems/","summary":"Understand the rising costs of maintaining legacy Amazon RDS systems and explore the new RDS Extended Support option for MySQL and PostgreSQL.","title":"Rising costs of running legacy Amazon RDS systems"},{"content":" TL;DR If you don\u0026rsquo;t care about my reasoning, just jump to the description of installation and usage . Click here for a demo .\nI try to read at least one book each month. It\u0026rsquo;s not much, but that\u0026rsquo;s what I can afford. I read a lot of technical books, building my technical skill set, but also a lot of random topics from business, psychology or fantasy.\nIt happen to me many times that when I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked about specific book, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t remember \u0026ldquo;Where did I read it?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;What was the book title?\u0026rdquo;. Some day I accidentally passed through Dave\u0026rsquo;s Rupert blog and his Bookshelf\u0026thinsp; external link and I loved it! I have a blog, so great place to collect and share, with easy access from anywhere - why not to use it?\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t want to add all those books manually as it felt a little bit an overkill, so I was looking for some kind of social network about books, where I could add books easily and just auto-generate the listing on my blog via API calls. I found GoodReads\u0026thinsp; external link , which was looking very promising especially that they documented their API1. There was just a little but\u0026hellip;\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been looking through few other alternatives, but didn\u0026rsquo;t found a good replacement \u0026#x1f626;\nThen, I have to add it to my blog. There were two ways I could do it:\nCreate a blog post per book and extract them on one sub-page. Use Hugo\u0026rsquo;s data templates2, so store Books metadata in YAML/JSON and generate page from it. Second idea was tempting, but what if I\u0026rsquo;d like to add a book review or short summary of it\u0026rsquo;s content? It\u0026rsquo;s just better to go with the blog post per book. It won\u0026rsquo;t take too much time to add it and I will have some obligation to write summary. It was decided.\nBookshelf Theme installation and usage It requires original PaperMod theme\u0026thinsp; external link , install it first\u0026thinsp; external link .\nClone PaperMod-bookshelf repo\u0026thinsp; external link to your project:\nas submodule (recommended) Add bookshelf theme to the Hugo site cd your-site-location git submodule add --depth=1 \\ https://github.com/tgagor/hugo-PaperMod-bookshelf.git \\ themes/PaperMod-bookshelf You might need to initialize any uninitialized submodules in the repository and then recursively update all submodules to their latest versions to make it fully available:\nUpdate git submodules git submodule update --init --recursive or by just cloning Add bookshelf theme to the Hugo site cd your-site-location git clone --depth=1 \\ https://github.com/tgagor/hugo-PaperMod-bookshelf.git \\ themes/PaperMod-bookshelf To activate the bookshelf, update config.yaml or hugo.yaml:\nUpdate hugo.yaml theme: - PaperMod - PaperMod-bookshelf Original theme should be first, followed up by extension.\nCreate a page where books will be listed, for example content/bookshelf.md with such content: --- title: My Bookshelf layout: bookshelf url: /bookshelf --- Of course you can amend the url and title. layout field is what identifies how it should be filled, so have to stay like that.\nAdd first book, by calling: Add example book for testing hugo new -k book books/2024/my-first-book Run your page and check /bookshelf URL, usually: http://localhost:1313/bookshelf\u0026thinsp; external link If you\u0026rsquo;re unable to get it working, check exampleSite\u0026thinsp; external link directory.\nAdding books Theme rely on posts in the content/books directory, to keep them outside of the typical posts. You might prefer other location.\nTo add new book, just create a new blog post of kind book:\nAdd book entry hugo new -k book books/2024/new-book It will generate \u0026ldquo;a blog post\u0026rdquo; describing the book, with additional fields which are required to make the mechanism work. They are:\ntitle: Book\u0026#39;s title sub_title: Book\u0026#39;s sub title date: Date when you read the book book_authors: - A list of - All the authors categories: # used for finding the books among other posts - Book tags: # categories of books, use/extend as you want - Biography - Business - Fantasy - Finance - Graphic Novel - Leadership - Management - Mystery - Politics - Pop-sci - Psychology - Security - Sci-fi - Science - Sociology - Technology - Trading book_rating: 5 # your raging 1-5 stars Archetype adds a shortcode book call, which I preferred over typical book cover. It add\u0026rsquo;s a nice header with book\u0026rsquo;s cover and can provide links to few websites (reviews, affiliate links, whatever).\nRest is up to you. You can write a review or whatever \u0026#x1f609;\nConsiderations on configuration Configuration related to the cover in the original theme might impact how books are presented. My config looks like that:\nparams: cover: responsiveImages: true hidden: false # hide everywhere but not in structured data hiddenInList: false # hide on list pages and home If you use hiddenInSingle: false, then book posts would always show a huge cover image as a cover. I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it. It\u0026rsquo;s best to leave this setting not configured.\nThen to hide the covers for books I hide them in every post by:\ncover: hidden: true That\u0026rsquo;s my preference, feel free to play settings according to your needs.\nFor more details, check the repo3.\nEnjoyed? https://www.goodreads.com/api\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://github.com/tgagor/hugo-PaperMod-bookshelf\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2024/04/create-a-virtual-bookshelf-with-hugo-and-papermod/","summary":"Learn how to create a virtual bookshelf on your Hugo site using the PaperMod theme, allowing you to organize and share your reading list with ease.","title":"Create a Virtual Bookshelf with Hugo and PaperMod"},{"content":" The Culture MapBreaking Through the Invisible Boundaries of Global Business\nAuthor: Erin Meyer\n\u0026ldquo;The Culture Map: Breaking Through the Invisible Boundaries of Global Business\u0026rdquo; by Erin Meyer is a highly insightful guide that explores how cultural differences impact international business interactions. Meyer presents a framework for understanding and navigating cultural complexities by examining various dimensions of communication, leadership, and etiquette across different countries.\nLet me explain first high and low context communication, as it\u0026rsquo;s required to understand the idea. The term refers to the amount of information conveyed explicitly in words versus how much is understood through context, such as non-verbal cues, background knowledge, and relationships.\nHigh-Context Communication Relies heavily on implicit messages and non-verbal cues. Much of the information is understood through context, shared experiences, and unspoken understandings. Communicators often use metaphors, body language, and tone to convey meaning.\nExamples: Countries like Japan, China, and Spain often use high-context communication.\nLow-Context Communication Relies on explicit, clear, and direct verbal messages. Information is conveyed mostly through words, and communicators are expected to be straightforward and specific. Less is left to interpretation.\nExamples: Countries like Germany, the United States, and Scandinavia typically use low-context communication.\nHow does it work in practice? Here’s a summary focusing on Germany, Poland, and Spain, with additional context for Pakistan, Russia, and India:\nGermany Communication: Low-context, direct and explicit. Leadership: Hierarchical but with a preference for a fact-based, logical approach. Decision-Making: Consensus-driven but valuing detailed planning and precision.\nRecommendations:\nMeetings: Be punctual and well-prepared. Germans appreciate structure and clear agendas. Communication: Be straightforward and concise. Avoid ambiguity and be prepared to back up your points with data. Feedback: Be direct and honest. Constructive criticism is expected and respected. Poland Communication: Between high-context and low-context, with some indirect communication. Leadership: Hierarchical but with significant respect for expertise and authority. Decision-Making: Often centralized, with leaders making final decisions after consulting subordinates.\nRecommendations:\nMeetings: Formal and structured, but also be ready for some flexibility. Show respect for titles and positions. Communication: Clear and respectful. Build relationships and trust, as Poles value personal connections. Feedback: Mix direct and indirect approaches. Be diplomatic to maintain harmony. Spain Communication: High-context, indirect and expressive. Leadership: Hierarchical, but with a focus on charismatic and relationship-oriented leadership. Decision-Making: Often top-down but can be informal and flexible.\nRecommendations:\nMeetings: Expect some fluidity with time. Establish a personal rapport before diving into business. Communication: Be expressive and read between the lines. Non-verbal cues are important. Feedback: Indirect and tactful. Focus on maintaining positive relationships. Pakistan Communication: High-context, indirect and relationship-oriented. Leadership: Strongly hierarchical with a respect for authority. Decision-Making: Centralized, often influenced by personal connections and trust.\nRecommendations:\nMeetings: Formal but expect small talk to build rapport. Respect hierarchical structures. Communication: Be indirect and polite. Use intermediaries if necessary to deliver sensitive messages. Feedback: Provide feedback in a way that saves face and maintains dignity. Russia Communication: High-context, often indirect with a significant use of non-verbal cues. Leadership: Authoritative and centralized. Decision-Making: Top-down, with leaders making key decisions.\nRecommendations:\nMeetings: Formal and hierarchical. Show respect for positions and be prepared for lengthy discussions. Communication: Be clear but tactful. Understand the importance of personal relationships. Feedback: Be indirect to avoid confrontation. Maintain a balance between honesty and diplomacy. India Communication: High-context, indirect and nuanced. Leadership: Hierarchical, with a strong respect for age and position. Decision-Making: Often top-down but with input from trusted subordinates.\nRecommendations:\nMeetings: Be patient and flexible with time. Build personal relationships and show respect for hierarchy. Communication: Be indirect and read between the lines. Emphasize politeness and respect. Feedback: Provide feedback gently to avoid causing embarrassment. Use a balanced approach. Group by key characteristics That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of detailed information, so let me try to sum it up by countries which share similarities within the key characteristics:\nGermany and Poland:\nBoth countries have low-context communication styles. They share similarities in their structured approach to meetings and preference for direct communication. They both value clarity and precision in communication and decision-making. Spain, Pakistan, Russia, and India:\nThese countries lean towards high-context communication. They place a significant emphasis on building relationships and reading non-verbal cues. Leadership tends to be hierarchical but may also prioritize personal relationships and charisma. Decision-making can be centralized, influenced by personal connections and trust. These similarities suggest potential areas for smoother cross-cultural communication and understanding, particularly between Germany and Poland due to their shared low-context communication style. Similarly, Spain, Pakistan, Russia, and India may find common ground in their high-context communication styles and emphasis on relationships in leadership and decision-making.\nOn the other side, it\u0026rsquo;s all about the spectrum on the axis and the distance between specific cultures. So Germans are more low-context, than Poles, which might be very low-context to someone from Spain. Oh, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it all easier \u0026#x1f609;\nConclusion I strongly recommend reading this book to anyone working in cross cultural, multinational organizations. Book provides insights into navigating the complexities of international business. By understanding and respecting these cultural differences, anyone can improve their communication, leadership skills or better influence decision-making across diverse cultural landscapes.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2024/the-culture-map/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book The Culture Map by Erin Meyer\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eThe Culture Map\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eBreaking Through the Invisible Boundaries of Global Business\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Erin Meyer\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;The Culture Map: Breaking Through the Invisible Boundaries of Global Business\u0026rdquo; by Erin Meyer is a highly insightful guide that explores how cultural differences impact international business interactions.

To make binaries (eg. sqlplus) available for execution, we can either add this whole directory to the PATH or symlink binaries one by one\u0026hellip; PATH wins because it\u0026rsquo;s simpler, but I don\u0026rsquo;t like it. Feels dirty. ZIP packages provide few symlinks for libraries, but you still might need to add few more to get it working. I don\u0026rsquo;t like to manually amend stuff directly in the /usr/lib. There\u0026rsquo;s a /usr/local/lib for that. You have to remember about ls.so cache. Overwriting LD_LIBRARY_PATH especially in Docker containers might cause troubles to load libraries from other locations. Adding proper config in /etc/ld.so.conf.d saves a lot of pain. Installation from RPM (yes, on Ubuntu!) It\u0026rsquo;s one of those crazy ideas, but surprisingly it have non obvious benefits. RPM packages have better structured file localizations (separate bin and lib). DEBs generated from RPM packages can be uploaded to the Nexus/Artifactory which would save developers trouble to fetch proper binaries each time.\nWarning\nThe only reason for me to go this way is to upload DEB packages to the central repo that I\u0026rsquo;m in control of. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have it, go with the ZIP packages.\nLet me demonstrate how to achieve it with a Docker builder pattern.\nRPM Dockerfile example FROM ubuntu:24.04 as builder WORKDIR /tmp RUN apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt-get install -y alien ENV OIC_VERSION 21.13.0.0.0-1 RUN curl -fsSLo oracle-instantclient-basic-${OIC_VERSION}.el8.x86_64.rpm \\ https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/linux/instantclient/2113000/oracle-instantclient-basic-${OIC_VERSION}.el8.x86_64.rpm \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ curl -fsSLo oracle-instantclient-sqlplus-${OIC_VERSION}.el8.x86_64.rpm \\ https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/linux/instantclient/2113000/oracle-instantclient-sqlplus-${OIC_VERSION}.el8.x86_64.rpm RUN alien *.rpm FROM ubuntu:24.04 # so I won\u0026#39;t need to purge them manually VOLUME /var/lib/apt/lists /var/cache/apt/archives ENV ORACLE_HOME /usr/lib/oracle/21/client64 ENV PATH $ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH COPY --from=builder /tmp/*.deb /tmp/ RUN apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt-get install -y \\ libaio1t64 \\ libnsl2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ dpkg -i /tmp/oracle*.deb \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ rm -f /tmp/oracle*.deb \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ # we might beed to manually fix some lib paths ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libaio.so.1t64 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libaio.so.1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ # let test if it works sqlplus -version If with ZIP package there were \u0026ldquo;few weird things\u0026rdquo;, there\u0026rsquo;s much more weird stuff here \u0026#x1f923;\nWarning\nYou have to carefully select the version of RPM to be binary compatible with your distribution. Check for glibc version or just experiment.\nWhy to even go this path? Because if you\u0026rsquo;re able to provide packages from central repository, the whole things became much simpler for users, less vulnerable to the outside changes (like Oracle changing/dropping URLs). Just take a look:\nCentral repo example FROM ubuntu:24.04 # so I won\u0026#39;t need to purge them manually VOLUME /var/lib/apt/lists /var/cache/apt/archives ENV ORACLE_HOME /usr/lib/oracle/21/client64 ENV PATH $ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH RUN apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt-get install -y \\ oracle-instantclient-basic_21.13.0.0.0 \\ oracle-instantclient-sqlplus_21.13.0.0.0 \\ libaio1t64 \\ libnsl2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libaio.so.1t64 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libaio.so.1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ sqlplus -version And that\u0026rsquo;s it!

One aspect I\u0026rsquo;m keen to address is expediting Search Engine indexing for pages that have been altered or updated. This is precisely the purpose of Sitemaps, a feature fully supported by Hugo1. However, there\u0026rsquo;s a limitation in how Hugo handles this by default. It sets the lastmod parameter to either the page\u0026rsquo;s creation time or the last build time. What I aim to achieve is a clear separation between creation and modification dates. This would signal to Search Engines to focus on scrutinizing only the \u0026ldquo;changed\u0026rdquo; posts, expediting their reevaluation—an approach commonplace in the Wordpress realm but more intricate with Hugo.\nFortunately, I stumbled upon the lastmod field that can be added to a post\u0026rsquo;s front matter. While this allows manual updating on a per-post basis, relying on memory might be fallible. Given that my pages are stored in a Git repository, I sought a solution to automate this process with some kind of pre-commit or post commit hook, but I discovered that Hugo offers just that \u0026#x1f913; 2\nTo enable this feature, simply add the following line to your hugo.yaml configuration:\nhugo.yaml enableGitInfo: true However, there\u0026rsquo;s a caveat: this feature requires full Git history; shallow clones won\u0026rsquo;t suffice.\nFor those employing Github Actions for their build pipeline, adjusting the checkout action is necessary. Set fetch-depth to 0 to ensure the full repository history is fetched:\nGithub Actions unshallow - uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: true fetch-depth: 0 As for myself, having recently migrated to Cloudflare Pages 3, I had to tweak the build command accordingly:\nCloudflare Pages build command git fetch --unshallow \u0026amp;\u0026amp; hugo --minify This same approach can be applied to other CI/CD configurations seamlessly.\nEnjoyed? https://gohugo.io/methods/page/sitemap/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://gohugo.io/methods/page/gitinfo/#last-modified-date\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://gohugo.io/methods/page/gitinfo/#hosting-considerations\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2024/03/automatically-setting-lastmod-in-hugo-pages-with-git-modification-date/","summary":"Learn how to automatically set the \u0026rsquo;lastmod\u0026rsquo; parameter in Hugo pages using Git modification dates to improve SEO and expedite search engine indexing.","title":"Automatically setting 'lastmod' in Hugo pages with Git modification date"},{"content":"Around 3 years ago I\u0026rsquo;ve checked the age of various base images available on Docker Hub.

While I can admit that VS Code is a solid editor, my personal preference always leaned towards Atom.\nHowever, over time, Atom started to feel sluggish. I collected numerous plugins over the years and it began to weigh heavily on performance, not just during startup but also during regular usage. Typing slow response was especially quite irritating.\nJust recently, I stumbled upon Zed3. Built in Rust and designed with a focus on speed, Zed intrigued me with the promise of recapturing some of Atom\u0026rsquo;s essence.

Unfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon to encounter Docker images where files are haphazardly scattered across directories, leading to confusion and unnecessary complications. Let\u0026rsquo;s delve into some best practices to ensure your Dockerfiles follow the FHS guidelines, thus avoiding common pitfalls and streamlining your container development process.\nBelow you can find the most important directories, from the perspective of Docker images. /dev or /root rarely are useful here.\ngraph LR root[\"root /\"] --\u003e bin[\"/bin\"] root --\u003e sbin[\"/sbin\"] root --\u003e etc[\"/etc\"] root --\u003e home[\"/home\"] root --\u003e usr[\"/usr\"] root --\u003e opt[\"/opt\"] root --\u003e srv[\"/srv\"] root --\u003e tmp[\"/tmp\"] root --\u003e var[\"/var\"] usr --\u003e local[\"/local\"] local --\u003e local_bin[\"/bin\"] local --\u003e local_sbin[\"/sbin\"] local --\u003e share[\"/share\"] share --\u003e java[\"/java\"] opt --\u003e app[\"/your-app-name\"] var --\u003e var_lib[\"/lib\"] var --\u003e var_cache[\"/cache\"] var --\u003e var_log[\"/log\"] var --\u003e var_tmp[\"/tmp\"] Organize scripts One frequent oversight is the placement of scripts and binaries within Docker images. Instead of cluttering the root directory (/) or other unconventional locations, adhere to the FHS guidelines:\nScripts: Store your scripts in /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/sbin for root-owned scripts. Placing scripts here eliminates the need to manipulate the PATH environment variable manually and ensures they\u0026rsquo;re easily accessible.\nDockerfile COPY script.sh /usr/local/bin/ Handle Java binaries properly Binaries and Artifacts: If your Docker image includes binary artifacts like Java jar packages or shared libraries, designate appropriate directories such as /opt/your-app-name or /usr/local/share/java. This practice maintains clarity and consistency within your image structure.\nDockerfile COPY your-app.jar /opt/your-app-name/ Handling Web Files for Web Servers When configuring web servers like Nginx or Apache within Docker images, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to adhere to FHS principles for storing web files. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can effectively manage web content:\nNginx: For Nginx, follow the convention of placing web files in /usr/share/nginx/html. This directory is the default location where Nginx looks for static web content. By adhering to this standard, you ensure seamless integration with Nginx configurations.\nDockerfile COPY --chown=nginx:nginx index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/ Apache: Similarly, Apache web server deployments should utilize /var/www/html for storing web files. This directory is Apache\u0026rsquo;s default document root, simplifying the setup and maintenance of your Apache-powered containers.\nDockerfile COPY --chown=www-data:www-data index.html /var/www/html/ Handling caches or temp files Writing files inside of container is generally a bad idea. Layered file systems like aufs or overlay provide poor performance, so if you really need to write files inside container, write them to volumes. First setup any permissions, then make them volumes \u0026ldquo;and freeze\u0026rdquo; them in this state. Volumes are bind mounted to the local file system on hosts so they provide much better performance.\nTemporary files: There are two most common locations for temporary files.\nDockerfile VOLUME [\u0026#34;/tmp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/var/tmp\u0026#34;] Cache: Set permissions before volume creation, because later it\u0026rsquo;s not persisting. Remember that those files are stored on local file system, so set reasonable limits. When container will be terminated, volume will be left, so your cluster should have some cleanup job configured to purge them.\nDockerfile RUN mkdir -p /var/cache/nginx \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ chown -R nginx:nginx /var/cache/nginx VOLUME [\u0026#34;/var/cache/nginx\u0026#34;] Summary By following these guidelines, you just make your life easier.

For over 15 years, I was a devoted user of Bash until I discovered Zsh and made the switch. One thing that remained constant throughout my transition was my configuration to maintain an extensive commands history. This setup is replicated across all my systems. When you spend a lot of time coding, you often find yourself repeating commands or running variations of them. Remembering all these commands can be challenging, but with resources like Google and ChatGPT, it\u0026rsquo;s not always necessary. However, if you find yourself frequently searching for specific commands, it can be time-consuming and distracting. That\u0026rsquo;s where having parts of the command at your fingertips becomes invaluable. With a quick press of Ctrl+r and a little scanning, you can find what you need.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s consider an example: Suppose you need to rename all *.md files in the current directory to *.en.md because you have to add multilingual translations to your 100 articles.\nI recall that I used the rename command for this task, but I don\u0026rsquo;t quite remember how. So, I press Ctrl+r, start typing rename, and there it is:\nrename \u0026#39;s/\\.md$/\\.en\\.md/\u0026#39; *.md It took me just a few seconds.\nWhile Bash allows you to recall only the latest command and requires multiple Ctrl+r presses to eventually find what you need, you can use fzf, which provides a fuzzy-find algorithm to search through the entire history. It allows you to find the desired command quickly using the \u0026#x2b06;\u0026#xfe0f; and \u0026#x2b07;\u0026#xfe0f; arrow keys.

I secured it behind Cloudflare to employ a custom domain and automate HTTPS certificate management. Additionally, I utilized a few Page Rules to implement redirects:\nFrom www.* to non-www, From HTTP to HTTPS, And for some SEO renaming. Unfortunately, in the Free plan from Cloudflare, you are limited to:\n3 Page Rules (with simple glob matching), 10 Transformation Rules (no regex rules), 10 Redirect Rules (no regex). I made use of a combination of these rules, but due to these limitations, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t meet all of my requirements. I have few hundreds of broken URLs reported by Google Web Console. Google still remembers that I migrated from Wordpress and attempts to index some paths I no longer host. Although I attempted to utilize Hugo\u0026rsquo;s aliases 1, it only facilitates 1-to-1 matching. I\u0026rsquo;m unable to address this issue within these constraints.\nOn the flip side, Cloudflare Page supports the _redirects file, which can host 2000 static and 100 dynamic redirects, totaling up to 2100 redirects 2. That\u0026rsquo;s more than what I need.\nI decided to transition static file hosting to Cloudflare Pages3. There\u0026rsquo;s a helpful article describing the configuration\u0026thinsp; external link , and the process is quite straightforward.\nNow, what I needed was an easy way to generate this _redirects file.\nGenerating _redirects within Hugo Basic syntax of _redirects files is simple 4:\n[source] [destination] [code?] I\u0026rsquo;d like to generate it automatically from Hugo\u0026rsquo;s aliases, then add few more. For that let create a new template file under layouts/_default/home._redirects with the following content:\nMinimum layouts/_default/home._redirects content {{- range .Site.Pages -}} {{- if .Aliases -}} {{- $new := .RelPermalink -}} {{- range .Page.Aliases }}{{ . }} {{ $new }} 301 {{ end -}} {{- end -}} {{- end -}} At the end of this file, you can add your own custom redirects. For me, these include taxonomy changes:\n/tag/* /tags/:splat 301 /category/* /categories/:splat 301 /main/* / 301 /author/* /authors/:splat 301 Now, in the config.yaml or hugo.yaml, add the configuration to handle the new file type:\nExtend Hugo\u0026#39;s config with this mediaTypes: text/redirects: outputFormats: _redirects: name: _redirects mediaType: text/redirects baseName: _redirects isPlainText: true rel: alternate isHTML: false noUgly: true permalinkable: false outputs: home: - HTML - RSS - JSON # I need it for the search - _redirects That\u0026rsquo;s it.

The domain in question was timor.site. This was the first invoice I had received from GoDaddy since they acquired Uniregistry, and to my dismay, it was significantly more expensive than what I had been accustomed to paying. With the year drawing to a close, I was reluctant to invest too much time or money into the renewal process. Frustrated by the cost, I decided to redirect my blog to another domain I owned: gagor.pl (where this blog was actually running in the past).\nHowever, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t anticipated the impact this move would have on my blog\u0026rsquo;s SEO. Despite redirecting all the content without making any changes, there were noticeable differences in the results and traffic.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s examine the raw data. The old domain, timor.site, appeared in search results over 150 times within roughly a month and I distinctly recall seeing a significant decrease in traffic in this time.\ntimor.site search result statistics\nOn the other hand, the new (technically old) domain, gagor.pl, garnered approximately 200 impressions over two months. During this period, one of the pages went viral, resulting in a considerable influx of traffic.\ngagor.pl search result statistics\nI also conducted an analysis of domain rank and other SEO metrics. Surprisingly, my gagor.pl domain boasted a rank of 4.6, whereas timor.site lagged far behind at 1.3. Despite its lower rank, the latter domain attracted more traffic. This served as a reminder of why I had initially opted for an international domain—to enhance its recognition on a global scale. However, the bilingual nature of my content, with occasional posts in Polish, could potentially confuse some of my followers.\nIt appears that the time has come to move forward and transform my site into a multilingual, with content segregated by language. This strategy should improve its international visibility and better align with the SEO requirements of my website.\nOf course, this transition won\u0026rsquo;t be without its challenges—implementing multilingual support will necessitate a considerable number of redirects. But as they say, progress often comes at a cost.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2024/03/seo-kicks-my-stats/","summary":"Explore the impact of domain changes on SEO performance and traffic, and learn strategies to improve international visibility with multilingual content.","title":"SEO kicks my stats"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been writing recently about best practices for patching and deprecating Docker images , but today I want to show how to automate a huge part of this process.\nYou might already hear about Dependabot1, it\u0026rsquo;s a Github\u0026rsquo;s way to notify developers about security vulnerabilities in their projects. Renovate2 is similar tool3, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t require Github. For my professional work I use Bitbucket, so Renovate feels more universal as can be used anywhere.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the main problem here? When we write Dockerfiles, we might install system packages (this is easy to update), but sometimes we have to fetch something from Github or Maven. Those binaries might not have a specific repository and updating them is a manual work. Variety of tools and ways of doing it, makes the whole thing a complex task.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where Renovate steps in. It provides a variety of \u0026ldquo;managers\u0026rdquo;\u0026thinsp; external link which can automatically determine package versions from known sources (docker, maven, npm, pypi and many more). Those can automatically make patching easier. There\u0026rsquo;s also special manager, called regex which allows to make impossible a possible, by finding dependencies for custom links. Let me show you how.\nHow Renovate Bot can help us? Without much configuration, Renovate can automatically detect changes in Dockerfiles and propose updates of parent image versions to their latest. That\u0026rsquo;s not much and if you \u0026ldquo;pin\u0026rdquo; parent images loosely:\nBase image pinning example FROM alpine:3 ... then it\u0026rsquo;s not really useful.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s getting harder when you want to keep up to date tools downloaded from different sources like with curl or git. For that, we have to prepare a syntax a little bit. Take a look at two examples:\nDownloading NVM with git. Git fetching example # renovate: datasource=github-releases depName=nvm-sh/nvm ENV NVM_VERSION v0.39.3 RUN apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt-get install -y git \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ git clone \\ --depth 1 \\ --branch $NVM_VERSION \\ https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git ... Downloading minimum init binary with curl. Curl fetching example # renovate: datasource=github-releases depName=krallin/tini ARG TINI_VERSION=v0.18.0 RUN curl -fsSLo /usr/local/sbin/tini https://github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/${TINI_VERSION}/tini-amd64 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ curl -fsSL https://github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/${TINI_VERSION}/tini-amd64.sha256sum | sha256sum -c \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/tini \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ tini -v ... Important part here is to use ENV or ARG and expose the version we need in single place. We use it to refer to the app version when installing.\nAnother important thing are # renovate comments. They provide metadata, pointing what kind of datasource 4 and dependency name to use, for example:\nmaven -\u0026gt; # renovate: datasource=maven depName=com.google.code.gson:gson github-releases -\u0026gt; # renovate: datasource=github-releases depName=nvm-sh/nvm docker -\u0026gt; # renovate: datasource=docker depName=tomcat check Renovate\u0026rsquo;s documentation\u0026thinsp; external link for even more sources. Renovate do not understand our comments yet, so let teach it \u0026#x1f609;\nRenovate config.js example module.exports = { // check for more here: https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/platform/ platform: \u0026#34;github\u0026#34;, gitAuthor: \u0026#34;renovate \u0026lt;renovate@example.com\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, forkProcessing: \u0026#34;enabled\u0026#34;, // renovate usually requires a branch or a config file in the repo, // I run it from separate project, to scan multiple Docker images repositories requireConfig: \u0026#34;optional\u0026#34;, onboarding: false, // to match those repositories, we have to discover them autodiscover: true, autodiscoverFilter: [ \u0026#34;tgagor/docker-*\u0026#34; ], // we will only use regex module in the example // feel free to add more as you need: https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/ enabledManagers: [\u0026#34;custom.regex\u0026#34;], // we\u0026#39;re adding custom regex matcher // more examples here: https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/regex/ customManagers: [ { customType: \u0026#34;regex\u0026#34;, fileMatch: [\u0026#34;/Dockerfile$\u0026#34;], matchStrings: [ \u0026#34;#\\\\s*renovate:\\\\s*datasource=(?\u0026lt;datasource\u0026gt;.*?)\\\\s+depName=(?\u0026lt;depName\u0026gt;.*?)(\\\\s+versioning=(?\u0026lt;versioning\u0026gt;.*?))?\\\\s*(ENV|ARG)\\\\s+[A-Z0-9_]+_VERSION[= ]?[\\\u0026#34;\u0026#39;]?(?\u0026lt;currentValue\u0026gt;.*?)[\\\u0026#34;\u0026#39;]?\\\\s\u0026#34;, ], // datasourceTemplate: \u0026#34;{{{datasource}}}\u0026#34;, // depNameTemplate: \u0026#34;{{{depName}}}\u0026#34;, // versioningTemplate: \u0026#34;{{#if versioning}}{{{versioning}}}{{else}}semver-coerced{{/if}}\u0026#34; }, ], // here we can add per package exceptions packageRules: [ // I keep separate image per major version of Node // so I wan\u0026#39;t to disable propositions for major upgrades { matchDatasources: [\u0026#34;node-version\u0026#34;], matchUpdateTypes: [\u0026#34;major\u0026#34;], enabled: false }, // similar for Python, I want to be informed only about patch // level updates { matchDatasources: [\u0026#34;docker\u0026#34;], matchUpdateTypes: [\u0026#34;major\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;minor\u0026#34;], matchPackagePatterns: [\u0026#34;python\u0026#34;], enabled: false }, // let enforce to use our maven repo cache // useful if you use Nexus or Artifactory { matchDatasources: [\u0026#34;maven\u0026#34;], registryUrls: [\u0026#34;https://use.custom.maven.repo\u0026#34;], }, ], // Git-related customizations group: { commitMessageTopic: \u0026#34;feat(renovate): upgrading dependencies\u0026#34;, }, branchPrefix: \u0026#34;renovate/\u0026#34;, }; The most important part in the config is the custom regex matcher in the customManagers section. It extracts metadata from our comments, and use them to query defined datasources for new version, so Renovate could propose us updated. If we have test images deeply, we can even configure it to auto merge changes if build is passing.\nWe can also use packageRules to define some custom rules on per package basis or group changes of specific type to not be flooded by PRs.\nI\u0026rsquo;m really fascinated by this tool.

Try asking this question and you will see disgust at best.\nFor many it\u0026rsquo;s the fist contact with make and often the last one, but not for me \u0026#x1f609;\nWhat make does? Let build a base line. make orchestrates tasks based on dependencies, executing commands to generate target files and keep them up to date efficiently. It streamlines software compilation and project management.\nAs simple as it is, it does few things pretty well:\ndetects changes in files (source -\u0026gt; binary), manages dependencies, manages default values for variables much easier than Bash, allows to build in parallel, OS detection, on my system binary is only 16kB in size, is available on any OS, and much more! My second contact with make - Postfix The second non obvious use of make I stood, was the way to refresh Postfix\u0026rsquo;s map files. With Postfix servers, you\u0026rsquo;ve been usually writing a bunch of text files like aliases, transports, etc, which have to be indexed to the binary Berkley DB format.\n/etc/postfix/main.cf alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/aliases To \u0026ldquo;generate\u0026rdquo; Berkley DB file you have to run:\nGenerate aliases database postalias aliases Which was producing aliases.db file. Other types of files required to use postmap command to generate them.\nThe more complicated the Postfix configuration, the more files you had. If you missed to update one of map files, your configuration wasn\u0026rsquo;t effective and you could spend hours debugging: why this f\u0026hellip; alias do not work?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where make comes handy 2. You can just drop the file like this:\ncat Makefile .PHONY: reload all: aliases.db access.db virtual.db reload aliases.db: aliases postalias aliases access.db: access postmap access virtual.db: virtual postmap virtual reload: postfix reload Let me explain what happens here.\n.PHONY: reload: This line declares the target reload as a phony target 3. Phony targets are ones that do not represent actual files. This is typically used for targets that don\u0026rsquo;t produce output files, such as clean, all, etc. It ensures that even if a file named reload exists in the directory, the reload target will still be executed.\nall: aliases.db access.db virtual.db reload: This line specifies that when you run make all, it will generate the files aliases.db, access.db, and virtual.db, and then execute the reload target. As all target is the default, it\u0026rsquo;s enough to just run make.\naliases.db: aliases: This line specifies that aliases.db depends on the file aliases. If aliases file is newer than aliases.db or aliases.db doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, the commands listed below will be executed.\npostalias aliases: This line is the command to generate the aliases.db file from the aliases file using the postalias command. postalias is a command used in Postfix to create or update the alias database.\nSimilarly, access.db: access and virtual.db: virtual are rules to generate access.db and virtual.db files from access and virtual files respectively using the postmap command.\nreload:: This line declares the reload target. When you run make reload, it will execute the command listed below.\npostfix reload: This line is the command to reload the Postfix service. It tells Postfix to reload its configuration, applying any changes that may have been made.\nSumming up, when you run make, it will generate or update the necessary database files for Postfix configuration (aliases.db, access.db, virtual.db) and then reload the Postfix service.\nNow you won\u0026rsquo;t make mistakes again.\nI know that today many of you would say: \u0026ldquo;just use Ansible dude!\u0026rdquo; But at that time, there was no Ansible yet. I didn\u0026rsquo;t use this pattern for years now, so let check more up to date usage examples.\nUse of make in Python projects I love Python for it\u0026rsquo;s simplicity\u0026hellip; at least when it comes to coding, because when you start managing dependencies, it\u0026rsquo;s getting tricky. What do you use: raw dependencies.txt or rather Poetry\u0026thinsp; external link or Pipenv\u0026thinsp; external link ? Do you use system Python or maybe pyenv\u0026thinsp; external link ?\nMy answer: it depends \u0026#x1f603;\nFor simple projects, I usually just use pip. Sometimes even without requirements.txt files, just listing in the README what to install. But the more projects I wrote, the harder it is to remember how to test them. Again, that\u0026rsquo;s where Make comes handy.\nSimple Makefile for Python projects .PHONY: requirements test .venv: python3 -m venv .venv requirements: source .venv/bin/activate \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ python3 -m pip install pytest test: .venv requirements dev-requirements source .venv/bin/activate \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ pytest What happens here?\n.PHONY: requirements test: Declares requirements and test as phony targets to ensure they are always executed regardless of file existence.\n.venv:: Creates a Python virtual environment named .venv if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t already exist.\nrequirements:: Installs Python packages listed in requirements.txt into the virtual environment created earlier. Additionally, it installs the pytest package globally.\ntest: .venv requirements dev-requirements: Sets up dependencies for testing, including the virtual environment and specified requirements. Then, it activates the virtual environment and runs the tests using pytest.\nAlternative config for Poetry, might look more or less like that: Simple Makefile for Python projects .PHONY: requirements test requirements: poetry install test: requirements poetry run pytest When I see Makefile in a Python project, I can blindly run make test and it will do what I expect -\u0026gt; run tests. Whatever it requires to configure or run, it will just happen.\nmake in Terraform projects Similar situation to Python, I have with Terraform\u0026thinsp; external link projects. In simple project you just need:\nTypical Terraform flow terraform init terraform plan terraform apply But what if you use different accounts for PROD and DEV environments? What if you need to fetch latest version of modules?\nI have a Makefile for this too.\nTerraform Makefile .PHONY: init SHELL=/bin/bash # those variables you should initialize outside of this script # and export, Make will just set then based on what you will # have set in your environment. You can use for eg. `aws sts` AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ?= AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ?= AWS_REGION ?= \u0026#34;us-west-2\u0026#34; # dev by default ENVIRONMENT ?= dev STATE_FILE_BUCKET ?= s3-bucket-$(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)-$(ENVIRONMENT)-terraform-state STATE_FILE_KEY ?= state/some_service/$(ENVIRONMENT)/terraform.tfstate # make some variable available in Terraform export TF_VAR_something ?= something1 export TF_VAR_something_else ?= something-else .terraform: terraform init \\ -reconfigure \\ -backend-config=\u0026#39;key=$(STATE_FILE_KEY)\u0026#39; \\ -backend-config=\u0026#39;bucket=$(STATE_FILE_BUCKET)\u0026#39; \\ -var-file=environments/$(ENVIRONMENT)/variables.tfvars \\ -out terraform.plan terraform get # this will switch Terraform version to the one that your project needs # https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv init: .terraform tfenv install plan: init terraform plan apply: plan terraform apply \\ -auto-approve \\ terraform.plan destroy: terraform destroy \\ -auto-approve \\ -var-file=environments/$(ENVIRONMENT)/variables.tfvars dev-plan: export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=dev-key dev-plan: plan dev-apply: export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=dev-key dev-apply: apply dev-destroy: export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=dev-key dev-destroy: destroy prod-plan: export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=prod-key prod-plan: plan prod-apply: export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=prod-key prod-apply: apply clean: @rm -rf .terraform/modules @rm -f terraform.* This file expects a directory structure like\nDirectory structure $ tree example/ . ├── main.tf ├── variables.tf ├── provider.tf ├── backend.tf ├── outputs.tf ├── ... ├── environments/ │ ├── dev │ │ ├── variables.tfars │ ├── prod/ │ │ ├── variables.tfars │ ├── .../ Backends configuration in the backend.tf file can be just basic:\nbackend.tf terraform { backend \u0026#34;s3\u0026#34; { region = \u0026#34;us-west-2\u0026#34; encrypt = true } } Rest of parameters are provided in the Makefile - it\u0026rsquo;s called partial backend configuration4. This configuration allows me to use same codebase for all the environments. All customizations have to be listed as variables in variables.tfvars files. It can be easily extended to suport 4 or 6 environments and the only thing I need to remember is:\nmake dev-plan make dev-apply make for Hugo blogging Even for blogging with Hugo I have a Makefile5 that I use across multiple sites.

Once they\u0026rsquo;re built, they don\u0026rsquo;t change. Built once, would work forever\u0026hellip; That\u0026rsquo;s how nightmares of security guys starts \u0026#x1f923;\nWe have then two contradictory concepts:\nflowchart LR id1(Keep it stable) \u003c---\u003e id2(Keep it up to date and secure) For day to day work, usually first concept wins. You want your builds stable and try to avoid tempting distractions of upgrading log4j to latest version\u0026hellip; Who knows what might break. That\u0026rsquo;s fine, makes sense.\nWhen is then the good moment to upgrade?\nIt usually happens once a year, maybe once a 3 years, maybe when we need feature or want to add Java 21 to our CV. Generally speaking \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s a special event\u0026rdquo;. For some developers it\u0026rsquo;s once in a lifetime experience. Taking into account how long they would stay in a company, they might not be there next time it happens.\nThere are obvious security risks of not performing updates, we saw it multiple times: Log4Shell\u0026thinsp; external link , POODLE\u0026thinsp; external link , Shellshock\u0026thinsp; external link , Heartbleed\u0026thinsp; external link .\nQuestion is: How to maintain updates, allowing developer to work?\nLet me share how we do it.\nDeprecate before deleting By deprecation we mean: mark as outdated, unsupported, smelly and crappy. It\u0026rsquo;s working still (on best effort) but will be gone soon. We usually point what should be used instead.\nDeprecation is a process which we perform for old Docker images, that we would like to drop or outdated tools which we don\u0026rsquo;t have resources to support anymore.\nTip\nWe do not delete anything instantly! We first notify about deprecation and notify, that breaking change will be applied on next quarter.\nHow to deprecate Docker image? It\u0026rsquo;s simple! Just drop something like this to your docker file:\nDeprecate Docker image ...

By seriously, I mean we\u0026rsquo;re touching everything possible to upgrade. We pin (hardcode) versions for all the changes, to ensure stable rebuilds. That\u0026rsquo;s usually a week of work for the team and then we drop a bomb by releasing those updates\u0026hellip;\ngraph TB A(Upgrade everything that can be upgraded) --\u003e B(Introduce new images) B --\u003e C(Deprecate outdated) C --\u003e D(Delete previously deprecated) D -- repeat\nquarterly --\u003e A Make upgrades visible Before we push upgrades or even before we start working on them, we\u0026rsquo;re performing a quick research on what we might be delivering:\ncheck new versions available (new Java, new Python, etc), check what we will drop (deprecated last time), check what we might change breaking contract and causing potential configuration issues. Usually it takes around 30~60 minutes to quickly scan what we planned to do last quarter, what will change right now. We use Semantic Versioning1, so we focus here on MAJOR and MINOR changes.\nWe send a quick mail with the summary of changes to all the IT people. Week or two later changes are deployed. It\u0026rsquo;s not much time you might say, that\u0026rsquo;s true, but it\u0026rsquo;s not our first notification. After we release upgrade we send more detailed mail with:\nall the changes that happen, all the deprecations (more on that later), plans for bigger changes for next quarter. sequenceDiagram Sprint start -\u003e\u003e Quarterly patching: Send email Note right of Sprint start: at beginning of the sprint,\nshort reminder,\nraw plans Quarterly patching -\u003e\u003e Sprint end: Send mail again Note left of Sprint end: detailed\nnew,\nupdated,\ndeprecated,\ndropped Info\nLast part of this message is important! We notify 3 months in advance about changes, that we\u0026rsquo;re already aware or plan.\nThis makes big difference, because dev teams know what will happen in 3 months from now. They can start prepare and plan time for the change. They can own it!\nIs it enough to upgrade quarterly? No, it\u0026rsquo;s not.That\u0026rsquo;s a bare minimum. If you do just that, you will be vulnerable just a few weeks after the Quarterly patching.\nWe try to limit, big breaking changes and upgrades to those quarterly events, but we still perform smaller upgrades between those big events.\nIt happen twofold:\nWe rebuild our base images monthly.\nEach rebuild will update OS system packages and install recent updates. This makes images bigger, but also us safer and is as simple as adding:\nRUN apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt dist-upgrade -y to our top level base images.\nThose are unattended and completely automated events. No big changes happen here, so they rarely cause trouble.\nWe usually work on Docker images between upgrades.\nAdding new features or fixing bugs. Those are usually MINOR or PATCH level changes, so they don\u0026rsquo;t cause much fuss.\nEach our change, triggers action from pt. 1 - upgrading OS packages.\ngraph LR A((Monthly rebuild\\nor on-demand)) --\u003e B(Upgrade OS packages) --\u003e C((Push)) Ask devs to use latest Docker image tag by default Christ, latest! Seriously?\nYes. We maintain our own base images and we encourage developers to rely on the latest tag by default. They can \u0026ldquo;fallback\u0026rdquo; to the tagged version if they face issues. This usually follows up with a ticket to check what\u0026rsquo;s wrong and get back \u0026ldquo;to the bright side\u0026rdquo; in next sprint.\nThis way they use recent images most of the time and when they\u0026rsquo;re not - it\u0026rsquo;s their responsibility to get back on the latest.\nWe (as a team) do not provide help/support if someone use non latest image version.\nEnsure latest tags are stable - test Docker images! We prepared a testing framework that allows us to test Docker images after they\u0026rsquo;re build. We used for that Pytest\u0026thinsp; external link and Testinfra\u0026thinsp; external link . Together with some bash in Makefile, we\u0026rsquo;re listing all the images and checking if they behave how we expect, if they start, run as non-root, etc.\nTestinfra allows to easily check any condition\u0026thinsp; external link . Pytest spins Docker image per set of tests. For around 200 images that we maintain, we run more than 1500 tests. Since we started doing this, it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to break basic functionality of images. This allows us to push harder with confidence that latest versions are stable.\nSum it up What was the impact of implementation of this process?\nThere are many positive aspects of it:\nScheduled upgrades: Changes are communicated in advance, reducing the need for immediate requests. Stability through testing: Rigorous testing minimizes the risk of disruptions during upgrades. Informed stakeholders: Developers and Product Owners receive early notifications, enabling better planning. Efficient deprecation process: Notices allow for timely reactions and signal the seriousness of image changes. Reduced change requests: Teams anticipate updates within the quarterly cycle, reducing the frequency of requests. Seamless bug fixes: Bug fixes and new features are implemented between major upgrades without causing disruptions. Clear deletion timeline: Deprecated images are scheduled for deletion in the following quarter, accelerating legacy removal. Collaborative issue resolution: Complaints prompt discussions and options for resolution, fostering collaboration. Flexibility in usage: Teams have the autonomy to choose whether to stay on older image versions if needed. Updates have to be delivered frequently - it have to be boring process, that every body expect.

I like slight bass boost, which adds this kick to the melody, but won\u0026rsquo;t overwhelm me after an hour of listening. I like when high tones are clear, but I get annoyed if they\u0026rsquo;re too strong. And finally, I hate all cracks, hisses or electric circuit noises.\nMy hardware I\u0026rsquo;ve collected a bunch of these over the years \u0026#x1f604;\nAsus Xonar DX Sampling Sampling rate SNR 24 bit 192kHz 116 dB I have it for around 10 years. It\u0026rsquo;s great. Well supported by Linux. Not supported by Windows 11, as it\u0026rsquo;s too old.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s one thing that irritates me - Intel cards used to automatically detect when headphone was plugged to the front panel and automatically switching audio to it, Xonar do not have it \u0026#x1f622;\nROG SupremeFX aka Realtek ALC4080 + Savitech SV3H712 AMP Sampling Sampling rate SNR 32 bit 384kHz 120 dB It\u0026rsquo;s integrated audio on my motherboard. It\u0026rsquo;s sometimes referred as a \u0026ldquo;premium audio\u0026rdquo;. The way it\u0026rsquo;s installed, pretends USB connection, to avoid any noises that could go via circuit (all digital). To be honest, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty decent - no cracks or strange noises, but Linux support was \u0026#x1f4a9; for quite a long time. S/PDIF didn\u0026rsquo;t work well until I upgraded kernel to 6.5. Even now, it happen that sound card is loaded but it\u0026rsquo;s not giving any output via S/PDIF until a restart.\nFiiO K5 Pro Sampling Sampling rate SNR 32 bit 768kHz 115 dB That\u0026rsquo;s my recent Xmas gift. Works well on Linux and MacOS. Provides more power, than I need with any of my headphones.\nLegacy of the PulseAudio PulseAudio was blamed for high latency and some \u0026ldquo;non optimal\u0026rdquo; decisions. Default configuration was enforcing resampling to 44.1 kHz always, where many media now use 48 kHz. This means that audio was resampled most of the time, even when my sound card supports higher sample rates. I wanted to avoid that and it\u0026rsquo;s well described how to achieve it on the Delightly Linux\u0026thinsp; external link 1 2 blog.\nRecent systems switch to new, better PipeWire audio system by default. I\u0026rsquo;d like to be sure, that I still get the best from my hardware. Not that I could hear the difference\u0026hellip; \u0026#x1f603; Just for the sake of doing it the right way!\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been looking for a good description on \u0026ldquo;how to tune it\u0026rdquo; and I failed. Arch\u0026rsquo;s Wiki3 is usually a good source, but there\u0026rsquo;s no direct description regarding quality. I also found some Reddit posts 4 5, but nothing step by step. Let me share what I found.\nTuning PipeWire PipeWire runs as a user-space service and it can use configs from per-system or per-user configs. That\u0026rsquo;s how it look like:\n/usr/share/pipewire - default configs, /etc/pipewire - system wide configs, to override defaults, ~/.config/pipewire - per-use configs, can use: full file names like ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf subsection replacements ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/ (same pattern works in /etc/pipewire too) It\u0026rsquo;s easier to play in user\u0026rsquo;s home dir, but I prefer to have it in the system space. As I found quite a lot of differences in those config files between Ubuntu versions, I like \u0026ldquo;subsection\u0026rdquo; approach as it allows to overwrite only the parts I want, leaving rest on defaults.\nDefault parameters After system installation my /etc/pipewire was just empty. I was wondering where can I check the defaults and I found it, under:\nCheck default configs ls -1 /usr/share/pipewire/ client.conf client-rt.conf filter-chain filter-chain.conf jack.conf minimal.conf pipewire-aes67.conf pipewire-avb.conf pipewire.conf pipewire-pulse.conf It\u0026rsquo;s a good source of documentation and examples.\nSet client resample quality When resampling happens, let it happen with the best possible quality. Look for resample.quality in the client.conf file, uncomment it and set to 10:\nConfigure resampling mkdir -p ~/.config/pipewire/client.conf.d cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; ~/.config/pipewire/client.conf.d/resample-quality.conf stream.properties = { resample.quality = 10 } EOF And another one for Pulse Audio:\nConfigure resampling mkdir -p ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf.d/ cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf.d/resample-quality.conf stream.properties = { resample.quality = 10 } EOF DSP configuration That\u0026rsquo;s my configuration I use:\nConfigure DSP mkdir -p ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/dsp-defaults.conf context.properties = { ## Properties for the DSP configuration. default.clock.rate = 48000 default.clock.allowed-rates = [ 44100 48000 88200 96000 176400 192000 352800 384000 705600 768000 ] #default.clock.quantum = 1024 default.clock.min-quantum = 32 default.clock.max-quantum = 8192 #default.clock.quantum-limit = 8192 } EOF Let see what happen here:\ndefault.clock.rate - PipeWire has one global sample rate used in the processing pipeline. All signals are converted to this sample rate and then converted to the sample rate of the device. That said, if you set it too low, it won\u0026rsquo;t use capabilities of your device. If you set it higher that the sources you use, it will be resampling to higher frequencies, which will just waste CPU time.\ndefault.clock.allowed-rates - This one lists the frequencies that are supported by your sound device. By default it\u0026rsquo;s set to [ 48000 ], which quite often will resample audio. To allow use of other frequencies, I had to manually list them.\nAlsa monitor config Theoretically: it specifies the supported input/output audio formats for ALSA devices. In this case, it is set to \u0026ldquo;all,\u0026rdquo; indicating that PipeWire should support all available output audio formats. This includes various audio formats such as PCM (Pulse Code Modulation), AC3 (Dolby Digital), DTS (Digital Theater Systems), and more.\nConfigure Alsa #cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/pipewire/alsa-monitor.conf cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; ~/.config/pipewire/alsa-monitor.conf [alsa-monitor] output_formats = all input_formats = all EOF Info\nI\u0026rsquo;m having hard time to recall where I found this and why I needed it? I will updated when I figure it out.\nReload PipeWire configuration To reload configuration files after the change, you can restart PipeWire like this:\nRestart PipeWire systemctl --user restart pipewire.service systemctl --user restart pipewire-pulse.service Warning\nSome applications (eg. Spotify) might not detect new sinks and will stay \u0026ldquo;muted\u0026rdquo;. Restart them to get the sound back.\nFor testing, command line tools like mpv or aplay are more reliable.\nHow to check if it works? Warning\nRestart PipeWire first!\nWe can check specific files effective configuration by calling:\nCheck config $ pw-config -n pipewire.conf list ... ], \u0026#34;config.name.d\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;pipewire.conf.d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;override.1.0.config.path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/home/timor/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/dsp-defaults.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;override.1.0.config.name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dsp-defaults.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;override.1.0.context.properties\u0026#34;: { ## Properties for the DSP configuration. default.clock.rate = 48000 default.clock.allowed-rates = [ 44100 48000 88200 96000 176400 192000 352800 384000 705600 768000 ] #default.clock.quantum = 1024 default.clock.min-quantum = 32 default.clock.max-quantum = 8192 #default.clock.quantum-limit = 8192 } or\nCheck config pw-config -n client.conf list ... \u0026#34;config.name.d\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;client.conf.d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;override.1.0.config.path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/home/timor/.config/pipewire/client.conf.d/resample-quality.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;override.1.0.config.name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;resample-quality.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;override.1.0.stream.properties\u0026#34;: { resample.quality = 10 } Check config pw-config -n pipewire-pulse.conf list ... \u0026#34;config.name.d\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;pipewire-pulse.conf.d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;override.1.0.config.path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/home/timor/.config/pipewire/pipewire-pulse.conf.d/resample-quality.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;override.1.0.config.name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;resample-quality.conf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;override.1.0.stream.properties\u0026#34;: { resample.quality = 10 } If all looks good, we should check if it\u0026rsquo;s working as we want by calling pw-top:\nAlternatively we can watch directly Alsa\u0026rsquo;s outputs:\nCheck raw Alsa\u0026#39;s hardware params watch -n1 cat /proc/asound/card*/pcm*/sub0/hw_params Is it wroth it? Probably not.\nOne difference I found between PipeWire and PulseAudio is some kind of delay, before the sink is closed. For example, if I start Spotify which will create sink with 44.1 kHz sampling rate and enable Youtube - it will keep 44.1 kHz despite Youtube working with 48 kHz. You\u0026rsquo;re usually not listening two sources at the same time, but it behaves the same even if I shut down Spotify and start Youtube \u0026ldquo;too fast\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s at least bunch of seconds, I didn\u0026rsquo;t found if it\u0026rsquo;s configurable yet.\nWith PulseAudio, it was instant. When I was checking PCM outputs, they were just switching instantly. With PipeWire, if I won\u0026rsquo;t keep OS silent for a while, it might start with much lower sample rates. You know, 44.1 kHz is more than I can hear, but it\u0026rsquo;s just disappointing and feels like a regression.\nI can see also other \u0026ldquo;silly\u0026rdquo; behaviors of PipeWire. At lest 2 of my cards support 32 bit sampling, but even if source use 32bit, Alsa usually use just 24. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s nothing I could hear, but if hardware is capable of more, why not to use it?\nThose are things I feel missing right now, but maybe it\u0026rsquo;s something that might be solved with more configs \u0026#x1f609;\nI can\u0026rsquo;t really hear the difference. I stayed with 192 kHz sampling rate as a default for few days. I felt rather tired, when listening too long and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t name what was the reason. 95% of the audio I listen comes from 2 sources:\nSpotify (44.1 kHz) Youtube (48 kHz) For me this means that the default of 48 kHz as a sampling rate is just fine. Spotify gets resampled up, which should be less harmful than resampling to the lower frequencies. That\u0026rsquo;s why I stayed there.\nTODO Force Alsa to use 32 bit sampling by default. My cards support it but I only see S24LE going to the output. Same like with sampling rate, why to convert if I should be able to just drop it on the hardware? 6\nI heard about Harman curve and I\u0026rsquo;d like to play with it. I have relatively good headphones: Bayerdynamic DT 990 Pro 250 Ohm. They sound quite well and don\u0026rsquo;t make me feel tired - I guess it\u0026rsquo;s a matter of open design. Still I think they\u0026rsquo;re strengthening higher frequencies. I\u0026rsquo;d like to use AutoEQ profile, to setup my headphones according to the \u0026ldquo;recommended\u0026rdquo; way. But I don\u0026rsquo;t like to do it with external equalizer app - PipeWire should be able to handle that, I just don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how :) 7 8\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read some day that the more I age, the less frequencies I can hear. Which means my kids might be hearing some noises which I won\u0026rsquo;t be able. There are even Ringtones for teenagers that rely on this phenomena. Teachers can\u0026rsquo;t hear them. 9 10 11\nhttps://delightlylinux.wordpress.com/2017/01/13/experience-better-sound-in-linux-with-the-asus-xonar-dx-sound-card/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://delightlylinux.wordpress.com/2017/01/23/asus-xonar-dsx-and-linux/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/wikis/Configuration?version_id=25749f548c1e2fddd9e1678d9b7e57ebfcae3cf2\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/xd8tg7/audio_quality_with_pipewire_dac/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PipeWire#High_latency_with_USB_DACs_(e.g._Schiit_DACs)\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://headphonesaddict.com/harman-curve/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://autoeq.app/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/high-frequency-hearing-loss\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.signia.net/en/service/hearing-test/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/how-high-can-you-hear-video-frequency-hearing-test/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2024/01/tuning-pipewire-for-best-audio-quality-on-ubuntu/","summary":"Learn how to tune PipeWire for the best audio quality on Ubuntu, ensuring optimal sound performance for your Linux system.","title":"Tuning PipeWire for best audio quality on Ubuntu"},{"content":"I use Git a lot, even writing this article i will commit text few times.

We run them as containers and because images are quite big, I was thinking about cutting the size, by cutting less frequently used features. I was looking for the metrics I could use to decide which changes are most valuable. I could think about two: download time and startup time. Together they combine to the gap between the request to start agent and the moment you can start to use it. Sadly it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that easy to measure that and collect statistics. It\u0026rsquo;s also not that practical, when you\u0026rsquo;re developing improvement as you can\u0026rsquo;t see the difference.\nI started thinking about alternative metrics and I quickly figured out, that I can check Docker image compressed size. It would be proportional to the download time. I can also compare compressed size with uncompressed size as it will show how much data have to be extracted, being proportional to the startup time. Although those KPIs are not as good, they\u0026rsquo;re fairy ok to use during development.\nThen I found, it\u0026rsquo;s not that easy to guess compressed size of Docker image. docker image ls shows extracted size. docker inspect shows compressed size per layer.

Few as a candidate but many more as a Technical Leader or Hiring Manager. There are many questions I\u0026rsquo;ve been asked and many tests I passed. I remember one test, where I had to install and configure Apache Tomcat on a Virtual Machine, under Windows (which I don\u0026rsquo;t use for years), without access to internet. There were more traps there, like some files in the locations where Tomcat is normally installed were blocked for write with chattr immutable attribute. I was able to configure the application to run, but then I asked what\u0026rsquo;s the point of this exercise? Main explanation was to \u0026ldquo;understand my knowledge\u0026rdquo;. I asked more questions:\nHow often do you work without access to Internet? Do they look for people with encyclopedic knowledge or those that can do the work? What about topics where you have to discover how to do something, that no one else did before? Do you often work on a systems where others prepare \u0026ldquo;traps\u0026rdquo; for you? Just to cut it here. I\u0026rsquo;ve been irritated, by the test. They\u0026rsquo;ve been irritated by my questions, although they admit they touch some points.\nThey propose me a job, but I rejected. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to work there. So how to do it better, what could be a better approach?\nReview as an interview That\u0026rsquo;s something we practice more often recently. Idea is simple, let see how candidate works in similar topics and environment we do. We prepare a repo, which is just not in the best shape (to say it gently). Actually it\u0026rsquo;s completely fine if you take one of the \u0026ldquo;skeletons in the closet\u0026rdquo;, remove sensitive stuff and throw more rubbish at the top of it like a cherry \u0026#x1f604;\nYou share this repo with candidate day or two before the interview. It should be enough time to get familiar with it, but we don\u0026rsquo;t want to make it too expensive and spend a whole week on it. We don\u0026rsquo;t expect any changes, any work in front.\nThe test question is: Check this repository and we would like to discuss what kind of improvements you would suggest?.\nIn our repo we have:\nbasic Terraform infra with unencrypted resources and few spooky policies, some Python code, some secrets committed, some comments of TODO/TBD/FIXME type, some rubbish accidentally committed, etc. Project should generally represent a landscape of technologies YOU use. There\u0026rsquo;s something for everyone and we already collected twice as much good advices, than we expected to hear \u0026#x1f604;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s more natural for people to work with such \u0026ldquo;test\u0026rdquo;. There will be people that will have a lot of Cloud improvement suggestion, but won\u0026rsquo;t touch the code, or vice versa. Some people would advice to replace Jenkinsfile with Github Actions, others would prefer to deploy with Ansible. You can guide this person through the repo, ask more targeted questions. Those are usually a good hook points to ask about specific technology experience or project\u0026rsquo;s size. You can see if they think big or small, if scale is similar to your expectations.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read a blog1 which I read and it\u0026rsquo;s quite aligned with what we do.\nDevOps interview questions The list below is with me for many years right now, but I still use some of the questions from time to time.\nThis is the more old school way of doing interviews. I collected a bunch of good questions, that I often use as a starters, to worm up a candidate or just go one by one if candidate is too stressed to discuss freely.\nGeneral Please tell us about one of your success stories – something you’re proud of, something you did and you really enjoyed (best if this is technical story). Please tell us about one of your failure stories – something you did but you’re not proud of it. (best if this is technical story)? Tip\nThose two questions usually go in pair. We start with something nice, something that this person likes and is proud of. This opens candidate and builds confidence. It often shows what this person likes to do - so you can consider how much of this type of work you have for her/him.\nWarning\nThe best part is second question - does he/she learn anything from mistakes?\nIf you could choose anything, what your dream job would look like? What you would like to do from the morning till the evening? Tip\nListen carefully if you can offer anything close to it. People have different expectations - some want to work mostly with Cloud, others with Ansible, they either like to work with people or they don\u0026rsquo;t - if you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to fulfill those needs, (s)he would most likely leave soon.\nDo you know what the term Twelve-Factor App\u0026thinsp; external link mean? Could you tell something about it? Note\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like 12 questions, on which you can discuss long hours. If you agree or not and why?\nWhat’s the difference between Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment? What Configuration Management tools do you know, which will you choose and why? Attitude How lazy are you? I.e. which tasks would you not automate? Note\nAutomation is core of DevOps work. We want people who can automate anything, test anything etc.\nBut we also want people, that can can do the math and won\u0026rsquo;t spend a week to automate one-time task taking 30 min.\nHow much access should Developers have to a production system? Set out reasons why. Note\nThis is about work culture in your company. Some people wouldn\u0026rsquo;t allow developers to touch anything, others work with them as with partners.\nHave you taken part in Agile/Scrum teams? Are you comfortable suggesting improvements to an architecture? Can you provide occasions you have? How would you handle a technical disagreement with a colleague? Do you consider yourself a developer, sysadmin, or other? Which is more appealing to you? Security, Performance, Features, Reliability. list them in importance. Who should be responsible for deployments? The team are planning on deploying an application change you believe is fundamentally unsound. How do you deal with this? Development Describe Language experience. MUST have at least good knowledge of on of Python, Ruby, Java, GoLang. Just Bash doesn’t count. Do you use GIT (or other SCM) in your daily duties? Can you name and explain any GIT workflows? Talk about a reasonable size development project you\u0026rsquo;ve created. What did you use? Which Frameworks? Describe the difference between a unit tests, integration test and performance tests. Talk about the tools you would use for each. At which stage of the development would you use them? Have you ever been working with SSO software? SAML/OAuth/Open ID Connect? Have you been working with Spring and dynamic properties? SpringCloud/Consul? How do you test infrastructure deployments? How do you version infrastructure changes? Describe the concept of idempotent calls and how it applies to CM tools. Please provide Github repo. If no Github repo, why not? What kind of communication patterns/protocols in micro-services ecosystem do you know? What are the advantages of using micro-services? How can you introduce an API / contract breaking change? DBs What DB experiences do you have? What DB engines do you used? We have shared between few apps DB schema. It\u0026rsquo;s starting to be a problem. What would you suggest? Types of SQL joins? Jenkins Can you elaborate on best practices on Jenkinsfile writing? Do you know how to create Jenkins pipeline libraries? Do you know what are best practices for pipeline libraries creation? Docker What are good practices for writing Dockerfiles? What problems arrive in services that run on Docker? We have 4 different environments: DEV, QC, UAT, PROD – there are small differences between them (ex. different login/password/IP on DB server). We use Docker to prepare images with our applications. What would you suggest to do, to reflect those small differences between environments but without need to build different Docker images for them?

Hiring people is hard, but having a new person in a team is not a work done. It\u0026rsquo;s important to monitor how people perform during probation period and share feedback with them. Personally, I like to ask the whole team, with a bunch of open questions, which allows me to look from higher altitude on the new hire. My point of view might be biased but by checking what others think, I can fill blind spots.\nSuch questionnaire can support my decision over I want to continue to work with this person, or maybe we (as a team) saw too many red flags and it\u0026rsquo;s time to part ways here. Firing people is never a pleasant task. It\u0026rsquo;s draining and leaves you often feeling guilty. But end of Probation Period is a moment that both you and a candidate expect some kind of verification and summarization. It\u0026rsquo;s important to take this opportunity and pause for a moment, collect the feedback and share it. This allows you to clearly say, what worked, what didn\u0026rsquo;t work. It\u0026rsquo;s the best moment to point the expected direction and ensure you\u0026rsquo;re both aligned on the target.\nThere are many questions that might be asked, but I rather try to keep a list of questions short.\nWhat to ask the team for? I prefer open questions. They allow to express more concerns or share custom perspective. Marek thanks for this awesome list!\nDo you have any story with NAME HERE that you would like to share? (does not have to be work-related) How likely are you to recommend working with NAME HERE to a friend, colleague or manager? Number 1-10 or descriptive text field What NAME HERE is good at and why? (name 1 thing) What NAME HERE should stop doing and why? (name 1 thing) What NAME HERE should start doing and why? (name 1 thing) Is there anything more that you want to share anonymously with NAME HERE? Info\nYou can use Google Forms\u0026thinsp; external link or M$ Forms\u0026thinsp; external link to prepare the survey. Putting questions in a mail will work too.\nDid you fill the questionnaire? No? Then do it!\nHow to prepare for the discussion We know \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo;, so let think about \u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo;. Conducting an effective employee evaluation at the end of the probationary period can contribute to a better understanding of their strengths, areas for improvement, and defining further development directions.\nBelow are some questions you can use when gathering feedback or evaluating your judgement:\nOverall impression\nWhat is your overall impression after the employee\u0026rsquo;s probationary period? Have you noticed any positive aspects of their work? Strengths\nIn which areas did the employee excel? Have you observed any unique skills that bring value to the team? Areas for improvement\nAre there any areas where the employee can further develop? Are there specific skills that need improvement? Team collaboration\nHow does the employee integrate with the team? Do they communicate effectively and actively collaborate with other team members? Engagement and motivation\nHow would you rate the employee\u0026rsquo;s engagement in tasks? Have you noticed any signs of motivation to grow within the company? Initiative and independence\nDoes the employee take initiative and work independently, or do they require constant supervision? Development suggestions\nWhat suggestions do you have regarding the employee\u0026rsquo;s further development? Do you see the need for additional training and development? Team goals\nHow has the employee contributed to achieving the team\u0026rsquo;s common goals? Do you see them as a valuable team member in the longer term? Communication\nHow do you assess the employee\u0026rsquo;s communication? Is it clear and understandable? Are they open in sharing information and receptive to others\u0026rsquo; opinions? Summary\nAre there any additional comments you would like to share about the employee\u0026rsquo;s performance? You should answer those questions as part of preparation to the meeting. Think about positive surprises and note them. Avoid criticism! You\u0026rsquo;re giving feedback both positive and constructive (some call it negative \u0026#x1f61c;) for the better future. Name your expectations in specific situations.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve got the answers! Now what? Usually it\u0026rsquo;s enough to sort data from the team, clear repetitions, polish phrases. Now, plan 1-on-1 talk with new hire and explain what you did and why. Yes, be honest about it.\nAsk if she/he want to hear the answers. Tip\nWhat if you hear back: \u0026ldquo;No, not today\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;? You asked, so you have to respect it. If you want feedback to be effective, person have to be ready to take it and you never know what she/he might be dealing with today. Ask for the date, within the time frame that\u0026rsquo;s acceptable for both of you.Don\u0026rsquo;t wait for the last day of the contract!\nStart with positive feedback. Ask if she/he agrees, what she/he thinks about it? Listen! Ask if she/he\u0026rsquo;s ready to listen constructive feedback too? Ask if she/he agrees, what she/he thinks about it? Listen! Share your decision on the continuation of the contract. If it\u0026rsquo;s positive, ask if person agrees with it and wants to continue collaboration. If you have concerns, share them and maybe propose another time limited contract. If you want to terminate the contract, share it - with compassion. This person, might be under heavy stress so be gentle and supportive. If she/he asks why? You have the list. Warning\nIf it happen, that you have to terminate the contract it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be your first talk on this matter with new hire. Red lights should be seen early enough to give you time to correct them BEFORE final discussion.\nFingers crossed and good luck! You can do it.\nIf you know better way or can suggest improvements, feel free and drop me a comment. I\u0026rsquo;m really curios how people approach it.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2024/01/how-to-give-probation-period-feedback/","summary":"Learn effective strategies for giving probation period feedback to new hires, ensuring clear communication and alignment within the team.","title":"How to give Probation Period feedback?"},{"content":"Nazbierało mi się w domu całkiem sporo różnych roślin. Problem w tym, że nie zawsze pamiętam jak należy je pielęgnować. Rzeczy typu częstotliwość podlewania, wymagane nasłonecznienie, rodzaj nawozu, częstotliwość używania nawozu, itd., itp.\nPostanowiłem to w końcu spisać. Na razie na jednej stronie i trochę na kolanie, by pokonać opór. Zamierzam to nieco uszczegółowić i wypracować jakiś schemat podlewania/nawożenia. Myślałem też o jakiś zabawkach do mierzenia poziomu wilgotności/PH - zobaczymy.\nZestawienie Roślina Podlewanie Nasłonecznienie Temperatura Nawożenie Storczyki Raz na 7-10 dni Jasne, rozproszone 18-24°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 2-4 tygodnie Skrzydłokwiat Co 1-2 tygodnie Jasne, filtry słoneczne 18-24°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 2-3 tygodnie Fikus Co 7-14 dni Jasne, rozproszone 18-24°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 2-4 tygodnie Cytryna/Mandarynka Co 7-10 dni Pełne nasłonecznienie 20-25°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 2-4 tygodnie Awokado Co 7-10 dni Jasne, pełne nasłonecznienie 20-25°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 4-6 tygodni Juka (Dracena) Co 7-14 dni Jasne, rozproszone 18-24°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 4-6 tygodni Mango Co 4-7 dni Pełne nasłonecznienie 24-30°C w dzień, 18°C w nocy Co 2-4 tygodnie Grudnik (Azalia) Co 7-10 dni Jasne, zacienione 18-24°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 4-6 tygodni Strelicja (Ptasi Kwiat) Co 5-7 dni Pełne nasłonecznienie 18-24°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 2-4 tygodnie Zamiokulkas Co 10-14 dni Jasne, umiarkowane 18-24°C Co 2-4 tygodnie Orchidea Co 7-10 dni Jasne, rozproszone 18-24°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 2-4 tygodnie Eszynantus Co 7-10 dni Jasne, umiarkowane 18-24°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 2-4 tygodnie Gwiazda Betlejemska Co 7-10 dni Jasne, zacienione 18-24°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 2-4 tygodnie Dracena Co 7-14 dni Jasne, umiarkowane 18-24°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 4-6 tygodni Palma Areka Co 7-10 dni Jasne, rozproszone 18-24°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 4-6 tygodni Drzewko Bonsai Ostrokrzew Ilex (Ilex crenata) Raz na 5-7 dni Jasne, rozproszone 18-24°C w dzień, 15°C w nocy Co 2-4 tygodnie Opisy Storczyki Storczyki są dość łatwe w pielęgnacji. Ważne jest utrzymanie odpowiedniego podłoża, które powinno być lekkie i dobrze przepuszczające powietrze.\nPodlewanie: Podlewanie storczyków zależy od rodzaju storczyka i warunków otoczenia. Ogólnie unikaj nadmiernego podlewania. Substrat powinien lekko przesychać między podlewaniami.\nŚwiatło: Storczyki preferują jasne, rozproszone światło, ale unikaj bezpośredniego nasłonecznienia. Mogą rosnąć zarówno w miejscach zacienionych, jak i bardziej oświetlonych.\nTemperatura: Optimum to 18-24°C w ciągu dnia i minimalnie 15-16°C w nocy. Unikaj gwałtownych zmian temperatury.\nNawożenie: Podczas okresu wzrostu (wiosna/lato), stosuj nawozy o niższym stężeniu co 2-4 tygodnie. Zimą ogranicz nawożenie.\nDodatkowe wskazówki:\nZapewniaj odpowiednią wilgotność, zwłaszcza w okresie zimowym, używając tacki z wodą i żwiru. Jeśli storczyk nie kwitnie, sprawdź, czy otrzymuje wystarczająco światła. Ogranicz podlewanie podczas okresu spoczynku (zimą) i kontroluj stan korzeni. Warto zauważyć, że różne odmiany storczyków mogą mieć nieco różne wymagania pielęgnacyjne, więc dostosuj opiekę do konkretnego gatunku.\nOrchidea Orchidea to piękna, ale wymagająca roślina doniczkowa. Oto kilka wskazówek dotyczących pielęgnacji:\nPodlewanie: Podlewaj orchideę umiarkowanie. Zaleca się podlewanie, gdy podłoże jest niemal suche.

My Blog is statically generated website served from Github Pages\u0026thinsp; external link . As Github don\u0026rsquo;t allow to easily set my own domain (at least in free version), I needed some kind of proxy that:\ncan serve page from my domain, will provide valid certificate for HTTPS. Info\nI know HTTPS for static site is a non-sense, but to keep it performant with HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 - you need it.\nObviously, static site is pretty fast even with default Cloudflare configuration, but as I\u0026rsquo;m doing it for fun\u0026hellip; let squeeze it \u0026#x1f604;\nWhat Cloudflare can offer us? Cloudflare offers many options that can impact both security and performance of the website. I will go through the options I usually configure. Some of them can be easily turned on on any website, others will have more sense on rather static page.\nWarning\nPlease, don\u0026rsquo;t turn one everything at the same time.\nEnable, measure with Page Speed\u0026thinsp; external link , SSL Server Test\u0026thinsp; external link , then continue with another option.\nSSL/TLS tuning Security goes first \u0026#x1f604;\nAlways Use HTTPS Turn it ON.\nI want it, you want it. It ensures all non encrypted requests will be redirected. Same could be achieved with a Page rule, but as you can only have 3 rules - you just save one.\nHTTPS is crucial for other optimization options to work.\nHTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) HTTP Strict Transport Security1 (HSTS, RFC 6797) is a header which allows a website to specify and enforce security policy in client web browsers. It makes no impact for the performance, but improves security and allows to get better grade in SSL Test\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#x1f604;\nWarning\nOne critical consideration when using HSTS on Cloudflare is that once HSTS is turned on, your website must continue to have a valid HTTPS configuration conforming with the HSTS header to avoid making the website inaccessible to users!\nI have it enabled.\nMinimum TLS Version Default is TLS 1.0, which provides the best compatibility. I wanted to kick my score in SSL Test, so I bumped it to 1.2. Most modern browsers support it.\nOpportunistic Encryption We have a rule to redirect everything to HTTPS so this one is a no-op, but might be left enabled. TLS 1.3 Turn it ON.\nThis one is important. TLS 1.3 provides much faster initial connection and 0-RTT (check later).\nSpeed \\ Optimization \\ Content Optimization Brotli Turn it ON. It does what it says.\nCloudflare Fonts It optimize font loading times for custom fonts. I don\u0026rsquo;t have them, so I don\u0026rsquo;t care. If you use custom fonts, you can try it, but measure if there\u0026rsquo;s any difference.\nEarly Hints Turn it ON. Rocket Loader Play with it :) On one page it was resulting in faster load times, but on my blog it made load times actually higher.\nAuto Minify Play with it :) It minifies text files by removing spaces, etc. As it\u0026rsquo;s done on the fly, it can slow down page load times for the first time. Follow up request should be cached by Cloudflare.\nIn my case, I minify all the files during the content generation, so I just don\u0026rsquo;t need it.\nCaching \\ Configuration Caching Level You can play with two other options on dynamically generated pages to avoid caching dynamic content.\nFor static page, Standard is fine. Browser Cache TTL It\u0026rsquo;s first place where we can enforce strong caching of our page in the user\u0026rsquo;s browser. I don\u0026rsquo;t like this option because it treat all the type files the same.\nCrawler Hints It won\u0026rsquo;t impact your page performance, but allows Cloudflare to share some of your page access statistics with Bing (which shares data with DuckDuckGo too)\nM$ call this feature IndexNow\u0026thinsp; external link .\nCaching \\ Cache Rules This is where the game starts!\nMost recommendations advice to configure Page rule and play around with Cache Level2 or Browser Cache TTL3 options. The problem is that in free version you can only have 3 rules and I already use one for redirection from HTTP to HTTPS.\nOther con of using Page rules is the way wildcard matching works there. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to use a star sign (*), to match multiple URLs. But to create rule matching image files like: JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP - I will need 4 rules. To handle CSS/JS and more, I will need even more. Dead end.\nWhat I wanted to achieve. My page don\u0026rsquo;t change too often\nAnd Github Pages sets cache TTL for images to only 10 days, it also do not set any cache for HTML/JS/CSS files. Github is quite reliable provider, but to improve world wide load times it\u0026rsquo;s nice to spread cache around the world and avoid requests to origin at all cost. Pages should be cached in the Cloudflare and served directly from there.\nMy target would be to:\ncache pages and static files in Cloudflare for 1 day, set browser cache for: HTML pages to 1 day CSS/JS to maybe 10-30 days (they don\u0026rsquo;t change frequently and each build provides new file) images of all sort 3-6 months (they don\u0026rsquo;t change at all, but are relatively big and it\u0026rsquo;s good to serve them from the edge locations) I found that Caching -\u0026gt; Cache Rules options, which allow to better tune the way cache works in Cloudflare. Even more, I can add 10 rules for free and within those rules I can use OR operator to make single rule to match multiple patterns. Perfect!\nCaching images rule Let tackle image caching first.\nOn specific domain, go to Caching-\u0026gt;Cache rules Create a new Cache rule. Under When incoming requests match… add: Field: URI Path Operator: ends with Value: .webp add another rule and repeat for: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .ico and whatever more you need Expression Preview should be showing: (ends_with(http.request.uri.path, \u0026#34;.webp\u0026#34;)) or (ends_with(http.request.uri.path, \u0026#34;.avif\u0026#34;)) or (ends_with(http.request.uri.path, \u0026#34;.jpg\u0026#34;)) or (ends_with(http.request.uri.path, \u0026#34;.jpeg\u0026#34;)) or (ends_with(http.request.uri.path, \u0026#34;.ico\u0026#34;)) Under Then\u0026hellip; block set Cache eligibility -\u0026gt; Eligible for cache set Edge TTL -\u0026gt; Ignore cache-control header and use this TTL under Input time-to-live (TTL) dropdown select 1 day (or more) set Browser TTL -\u0026gt; Override origin and use this TTL under Input time-to-live (TTL) dropdown select 6 months (that\u0026rsquo;s minimal to make to stop https://pagespeed.web.dev/\u0026thinsp; external link from complaining) enable Serve stale content while revalidating Warning\nCloudflare updated the option (or fixed a typo). Now when option is enabled it\u0026rsquo;s NOT caching. Check the new screenshot:\nI discovered by accident that my JS files were not cached.\nHit Deploy button Check my config below: What it does? Matching URI\u0026rsquo;s by extension should be clear, then we enable cache, which we want too. Now is the interesting part.\nEdge TTL - by setting this option, we enforce edge Cloudflare servers to ignore headers returned from Github pages and store matching responses for 1 day. I could probably go with 7 or 30 days, but if I eventually change any image I won\u0026rsquo;t need to purge cache. Cloudflare will just keep files for 1 day on it\u0026rsquo;s proxies and revalidate them next day. Browser TTL - above we configure \u0026ldquo;the server side\u0026rdquo; cache. Here we tell our users browsers how to treat files from our page. At least for images it makes sense to set pretty long caching time. Google\u0026rsquo;s Page Speed test stopped complaining about too short caching time after I set it up to 6 months. Serve stale content while revalidating - my page is static. Content changes infrequently and when it does, it\u0026rsquo;s not critical if change will became visible slightly later. But with this option enabled Cloudflare will server whatever he have in their cache and if it\u0026rsquo;s expired, then it will fetch it and update cache. What\u0026rsquo;s important - user don\u0026rsquo;t need to wait. This changes time to first byte from around 1~1.5s to 0.1s. Caching HTML/CSS/JS files Caching text files differs from images. With images you want to cache them for a long time as they don\u0026rsquo;t change. If they do, they change spectacularly, usually with the new URL.\nChanges to text documents happen more often, especially on a blog - small update, fixing some typos, etc. You want them to be visible fast. Not necessarily immediately, but fast.\nLet build another rule. With CSS and JS files it\u0026rsquo;s easy - we match the end of URI Path with their extensions. Done.\nWith HTML files it\u0026rsquo;s harder, because not all page URLs end with HTML extension. It\u0026rsquo;s also not possible to match rule by Content Type (which is such a pity). But we can match a Request Header. We can use Accept header\u0026thinsp; external link as a hook, because when browsers request HTML files they usually do it like that:\nAccept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml, application/xml;q=0.9, image/webp, */*;q=0.8 We can then match Accept Request Header if it contains text/html - that would be quite probable HTML file \u0026#x1f604;\nWarning\nI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t use it on any dynamically generated, production site without extensive testing. In my case a static site is safe to assume those are HTML files and nothing else.\nLet take a look how does it look completely: We can deploy the rule now.\nSummary Those are all options I use in the Cloudflare for my static pages. There are many more variations on the topic, like CLoudflare Pages\u0026thinsp; external link which might be nice alternative to Github Pages and could further improve loading speed.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good to have a small site or blog to play around before you will turn it all ON.\nUse services like:\nPage Speed\u0026thinsp; external link SSL Server Test\u0026thinsp; external link To verify the real impact of your changes. Having RUM monitoring\u0026thinsp; external link might be even better.\nGood luck and sub zero loading times for your pages!\nEnjoyed? https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/http-strict-transport-security/\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/page-rules/reference/recommended-rules/#security-level-and-cache-level\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/page-rules/reference/recommended-rules/#edge-cache-ttl-and-browser-cache-ttl\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2024/01/maximizing-page-performance-and-security-with-cloudflare-tuning/","summary":"Learn how to maximize page performance and security by tuning Cloudflare settings, specifically for a statically generated blog hosted on GitHub Pages.","title":"Maximizing page performance and security with Cloudflare tuning"},{"content":"Almost 2 years ago I was promoted to a Team Lead position.

It presents historical examples to illustrate how power operates in different settings, from politics to business and beyond. While some readers treat it as a guide for personal success, others see it as a cautionary analysis of how power-hungry individuals operate.\nKey Insights and Laws One of the most striking laws in the book is Law 1: Never Outshine the Master. This suggests that making your boss feel insecure about your competence can backfire, as they may see you as a threat rather than an asset. If you have a great leader, they will recognize your talent and support your growth. However, many bosses may feel intimidated and attempt to suppress your progress to secure their own position.\nAnother law that stands out is Law 9: Win Through Actions, Never Through Argument. This principle resonates with my experience in technical support and guidance. Instead of trying to convince people with words, it is often more effective to demonstrate solutions through action. People are more likely to accept new methods when they see them working rather than when they feel their current approach is being criticized.\nStrengths and Weaknesses A major strength of the book is that it provides valuable insights into real-world power dynamics. Even if we dislike these tactics, they undeniably influence many aspects of society. Recognizing them can help us navigate workplace politics, leadership, and social interactions more effectively.\nHowever, the book also has significant drawbacks. The strategies it promotes can seem ruthless and manipulative, encouraging an amoral approach to power. While understanding these laws is useful, actively applying them could lead to unethical behavior and strained relationships. For this reason, I wouldn’t recommend studying and practicing them as a guide to life, but rather using the book to recognize how power functions around us.\nFinal Thoughts The 48 Laws of Power is an eye-opening book that exposes the hidden rules of influence and authority.

However, it\u0026rsquo;s worth considering certain mistakes that make it difficult for us to interact with people, such as when we talk too much and don\u0026rsquo;t let others get a word in.\nEither way, I think the book is about manipulation. Yes, if we apply the principles sincerely, it can improve interactions in specific situations. However, if we start using certain techniques automatically, we may influence others \u0026ldquo;more intensely\u0026rdquo; than before, as if bypassing their firewall \u0026#x1f604;\nRegardless, it was an enjoyable read, so I took the liberty of jotting down the rules to occasionally glance at and remind myself \u0026#x1f642;\nBasic Principles in Human Relations Don\u0026rsquo;t criticize, condemn, or complain.\nInstead of condemning people, let\u0026rsquo;s try to understand them. Let\u0026rsquo;s think about why they do what they do. It\u0026rsquo;s more beneficial, it breeds sympathy, tolerance, and kindness.\nGive honest and sincere appreciation.\nStop thinking about your own accomplishments and wishes. Try to see the virtues of the other person. Forget flattery, give honest and sincere appreciation.\nArouse in others an eager want.\nWhen we come up with a great idea, instead of emphasizing at every turn that it\u0026rsquo;s ours, let\u0026rsquo;s try to let others consider it their own. They will like it more and perhaps even take a few servings.\nSix Ways to Make People Like You Show genuine interest in others.\n\u0026ldquo;We are interested in others when they are interested in us.\u0026rdquo; Showing interest must be sincere. It must benefit not only the person showing interest but also the one who is its object. It works both ways, and both parties benefit.\nSmile.\n\u0026ldquo;A person who doesn\u0026rsquo;t smile shouldn\u0026rsquo;t open a shop.\u0026rdquo; Your smile is a messenger of your good will. Your smile brightens the lives of all who see it. For someone who sees dozens of gloomy and cloudy faces averting their eyes, your smile is a ray of sunshine breaking through the clouds. Especially when that person is being harassed by their boss, customers, teachers, parents, or children, your smile reminds them that not everything is hopeless, that there is still joy in the world.\nRemember that a person\u0026rsquo;s name is to them the sweetest and most important sound in any language.\nWe should realize the importance of names and always remember that they are sacred and exclusive property of the person we are talking to. No one else\u0026rsquo;s! A name distinguishes an individual from others, making them unique among all people. The information we provide or the request we make takes on special significance if we add the name of our interlocutor. From the waitress to the president - a remembered name works wonders in our interactions with them.\nBe a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.\nIf you want to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. Show interest in others, and you will seem interesting to them. Ask questions that the interlocutor will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments. Remember that the people you talk to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their problems than in you and the matters that concern you.\nTalk in terms of the other person\u0026rsquo;s interests.\nTalking to people in terms of what interests them rather than what interests us benefits both parties.\nMake the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.\n\u0026ldquo;Talk to people about themselves, and they will listen for hours.\u0026rdquo;\nHow to Win People to Your Way of Thinking The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.\nWelcome the disagreement. Control your temper. Listen first. Look for areas of agreement. Be honest. Promise to think over your opponent\u0026rsquo;s ideas and study them carefully. Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. Show respect for the other person\u0026rsquo;s opinions. Never say, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re wrong.\u0026rdquo;\nIn other words, don\u0026rsquo;t argue with your customer, spouse, or adversary. Don\u0026rsquo;t tell them they\u0026rsquo;re wrong; don\u0026rsquo;t make them defensive. Use a bit of diplomacy.\nIf you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.\nConsider also that I don\u0026rsquo;t fully agree with everything. Not everything I wrote yesterday speaks to me with the same force\u0026hellip;\nBegin in a friendly way.\nThe sun can make you take off your coat faster than the wind. And kindliness, a friendly approach, and appreciation can induce people to change their minds faster than all the storms and tempests in the world.\nGet the other person saying \u0026ldquo;yes, yes\u0026rdquo; immediately.\n\u0026hellip; He asked questions to which his interlocutor had to answer in the affirmative. And he gathered affirmative responses one after another, until he had a whole mountain of agreements behind him. He asked questions so persistently that his opponent, without realizing it, came to conclusions he would have vehemently protested against just a few minutes earlier.\nLet the other person do a great deal of the talking.\nEven friends prefer to tell us about their achievements rather than listen to us bragging about our own.\nLet the other person feel that the idea is theirs.\nTry honestly to see things from the other person\u0026rsquo;s point of view.\nIf reading this book achieves nothing else but making you always try to see things from the other person\u0026rsquo;s point of view\u0026hellip; you will quickly find it to be a turning point\u0026hellip;\nBe sympathetic with the other person\u0026rsquo;s ideas and desires.\n\u0026ldquo;All of humanity craves sympathy and understanding.\u0026rdquo;\nAppeal to the nobler motives.\n\u0026hellip; People are honest and want to live up to their obligations\u0026hellip; even those who want to take us for a ride will, in most cases, react honestly if we let them know we consider them honest, decent, and upright.\nDramatize your ideas. It\u0026rsquo;s not just the facts, but the way they are presented that matters.\nThrow down a challenge. This is what every successful person loves: the gamble. The chance to show their worth. The chance to prove themselves, to compete, and to win.\nBe a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment Begin with praise and honest appreciation.\nCall attention to people\u0026rsquo;s mistakes indirectly.\nSuggest alternative usage, propose looking in the mirror, and making decisions independently.\nTalk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.\nAsk questions instead of giving direct orders.\nLet the other person save face.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not what I think of him that matters, but what he thinks of himself.\nPraise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be \u0026ldquo;hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.\u0026rdquo;\nGive the other person a fine reputation to live up to.\nUse encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.\nMake the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.\nShow the benefits of the task for the performer to reduce their resistance.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2023/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book How to Win Friends \u0026amp; Influence People by Carnegie Dale\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eHow to Win Friends \u0026amp; Influence People\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Carnegie Dale\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe book is written in a typical American style - \u0026ldquo;do this and that, and your life will change forever\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; \u0026#x1f604;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApplying the book\u0026rsquo;s rules too bluntly may come off as manipulative, and our conversation partner will sense it.

Here are some of the main concepts from the book:\nEmbracing Discomfort: Kahane emphasizes the importance of stepping outside one\u0026rsquo;s comfort zone when working with people with differing perspectives. Embracing discomfort allows individuals to open up to new ideas and find common ground.\nActive Listening: The book stresses the significance of active listening as a crucial skill for effective collaboration. By truly understanding the concerns and motivations of others, individuals can build trust and find areas of agreement.\nCommon Ground: Kahane explores the idea of identifying common ground, even in the most challenging situations. Finding shared interests or goals can serve as a foundation for collaboration and problem-solving.\nInnovation Through Conflict: The book challenges the notion that conflict is always detrimental. Instead, Kahane suggests that constructive conflict can lead to innovation and creative solutions when approached with an open mind.\nAdaptive Leadership: Kahane introduces the concept of adaptive leadership, which involves adjusting one\u0026rsquo;s approach based on the evolving dynamics of a situation. This adaptability is crucial when dealing with complex and changing collaborative environments.\nReal-World Examples: Throughout the book, Kahane illustrates his concepts with real-world examples and case studies, making the principles tangible and applicable to various professional and personal contexts.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t see this book as a big discover, although it surprised me by stating that \u0026ldquo;sometimes you can\u0026rsquo;t reach agreement\u0026rdquo;.

Based on the author\u0026rsquo;s experience and the world\u0026rsquo;s number-one business podcast, Manager Tools, the book teaches four critical behaviors and four major tools that every manager should use. Here are some of the main concepts presented in the book:\nOne-on-ones: A weekly 30-minute meeting with each direct report to build trust, communication, and performance. The agenda is simple: 10 minutes for the direct report, 10 minutes for the manager, and 10 minutes for coaching or feedback. Feedback: A way to communicate how the direct report\u0026rsquo;s behavior affects the team\u0026rsquo;s results. The feedback model is: ask, tell, encourage or discourage. For example: \u0026ldquo;Can I give you some feedback? When you deliver your reports on time, it makes our team look more professional. Keep it up.\u0026rdquo; Coaching: A process to help the direct report improve their skills and achieve their goals. The coaching model is: collaborate, ask, tell, commit. For example: \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about your goal of becoming a senior analyst. What are some of the skills you need to develop? How can I help you with that? What are you going to do next? When can we follow up on your progress?\u0026rdquo; Delegation: A technique to assign tasks and responsibilities to the direct report, while maintaining accountability and quality. The delegation model is: describe, clarify, confirm, monitor. For example: \u0026ldquo;I need you to prepare a presentation for the client meeting next week. It should include the following points: \u0026hellip; Do you have any questions? What are the next steps? How will I know you\u0026rsquo;re on track?\u0026rdquo; The best about this books is, that it provides step by step explanation of what to do, how to start, etc. Especially as new people manager, you just might not know what might work and what might not - here you will find it. There are things that hit me by it\u0026rsquo;s simplicity, for example: as a leader you\u0026rsquo;re not a part of the team - you can impact how much people earn or fire them, it\u0026rsquo;s not equal partnership and they know it. It\u0026rsquo;s straight, simple and honest. That\u0026rsquo;s how you also feel about your boss. You might be in good relations, but there still will be things you won\u0026rsquo;t say your boss. Remember about it sitting on the other side and don\u0026rsquo;t be naive expecting that people will ignore your recent promotion. It might take some time, but they will figure it out.\nSecond edition have some updates, especially on the remote work.

If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a quick solution, skip to the \u0026ldquo;What eventually worked?\u0026rdquo; section. However, if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the thought process behind the solution, keep reading.\nWhy? Some might bother why the hell I\u0026rsquo;d like to make my life so hard? \u0026#x1f923;\nWe used to use nodeenv\u0026thinsp; external link for that purpose. It provides a simple script that allows to fetch any version of Node. You have to configure PATH variable and you\u0026rsquo;re done. It\u0026rsquo;s very simple from the perspective of Docker images operator. There\u0026rsquo;s one problem with nodeenv comparing it to the nvm - popularity.\nnodeenv nvm I was explaining to a lot of people, how to use nodeenv. No one knew it! But many of them knew nvm and were asking: Why can\u0026rsquo;t I just install version of Node that my project needs with NVM? That\u0026rsquo;s how I started thinking about better ways to deal with Node version management.\nI\u0026rsquo;m supporting organization with thousands of projects. Node projects can be counted in hundreds. It\u0026rsquo;s not possible to provide up to date base images for all the Node versions that people would request. But I can provide a base, which would allow to install any Node version you need on up to date base images. That\u0026rsquo;s what this article is about.\nNVM is nice and simple, how hard it might be to get it working with CI/CD? Over the past few days, I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on providing nvm\u0026thinsp; external link for both my company\u0026rsquo;s Docker base images and for CI/CD. However, it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been an easy task.\nIn general, nvm (know as Node Version Manager) is loved by frontend developers because it allows them to drop a .nvmrc file in their project, and each time they switch between projects, everything works seamlessly. nvm is responsible for installing (or activating) the version of Node required by a specific project. A similar functionality is provided by nodeenv\u0026thinsp; external link , which is Python-based and based on virtualenv\u0026thinsp; external link .\nWhile setting up nodeenv is straightforward because it\u0026rsquo;s a regular CLI command, nvm is not. When you follow nvm\u0026rsquo;s installation instructions1, you end up with something like the following code in one of the startup files (~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.zshrc):\nTypical nvm installation in ~/.bashrc export NVM_DIR=\u0026#34;$HOME/.nvm\u0026#34; [ -s \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; . \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; [ -s \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\u0026#34; ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; . \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\u0026#34; Installing nvm involves \u0026ldquo;sourcing\u0026rdquo; (that\u0026rsquo;s what . do) nvm.sh with some shell functions into your current shell. This is not a big deal for your local machine, but it becomes an issue if you want to use nvm in non-interactive shells for your CI/CD.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take bash as an example. Suddenly, it becomes important to know which file you\u0026rsquo;ve put the nvm lines in because not all of them are loaded for non-interactive shells2. The startup files for bash (in order) are:\nInteractive (called with --login) /etc/profile ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_login ~/.profile Non-interactive ~/.bashrc It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that ~/.profile usually loads ~/.bashrc automatically (check yours). But what about sh, dash or zsh? If you\u0026rsquo;re calling nvm on Jenkins, what shell will it call? These varieties of combinations make it incredibly hard to make nvm behave consistently.\nTo better understand my use case, I use:\nJenkins\u0026thinsp; external link for CI/CD Which runs as a Docker container on a K8S cluster The container contains most of the tools needed by developers (but just single LTS version of Node). Getting it working in the Dockerfile I eventually found a nice way to make nvm work in a Dockerfile - by using the SHELL directive\u0026thinsp; external link . By default, it\u0026rsquo;s set to: [\u0026quot;/bin/sh\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;-c\u0026quot;].\nThis shell does not load the files we need and starts a non-interactive shell. We can fix it with:\nEnforcing interactive shell in the Dockerfile SHELL [\u0026#34;/usr/bin/bash\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;--login\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-c\u0026#34;] The whole Dockerfile might look like this: Example Dockerfile FROM ubuntu:22.04 as fetcher ENV NVM_VERSION v0.39.3 RUN apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt-get install -y git \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ git clone \\ --depth 1 \\ --branch $NVM_VERSION \\ https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git FROM ubuntu:22.04 # we don\u0026#39;t want to store cached files in the image VOLUME /var/cache/apt # prerequisites RUN apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt-get install -y curl SHELL [\u0026#34;/bin/bash\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;--login\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-c\u0026#34;] ENV NVM_DIR=/opt/nvm # copy the nvm COPY --from=fetcher nvm $NVM_DIR # change ownership if needed RUN chown -R $(id -un):$(id -gn) $NVM_DIR \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ echo \u0026#39;[ -s \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; . \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; --no-use\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.profile What happen here?\nA shallow clone of the nvm repository is performed with git and it\u0026rsquo;s pinned to a specific version.\nThe final image requires some dependencies such as bash and curl.\nThe SHELL is set to pretend interactive.\nThe nvm files are copied to /opt/nvm.\nchown is used to set the ownership of the files.\nThe steps in the installation guide1 are followed with some exceptions such as setting the NVM_DIR environment variable directly in the Dockerfile, and skipping bash completion.\nThe sourcing of nvm.sh is followed by --no-use to lazily load nvm so that it\u0026rsquo;s not loaded until it\u0026rsquo;s used3.\nLastly, you can test if it\u0026rsquo;s working by adding some commands at the end of the Dockerfile to check the nvm version, install different versions of Node, and check their versions as well.\nGetting it working in Jenkins The pattern of running Jenkins agents as containers is great for packing development tools into Docker images and running them when needed. However, it can be challenging to get nvm.sh sourced properly when Jenkins agents are started as containers.\nNow that we have a working nvm in Docker image, we can use it in Jenkins. The easiest way is to use the Docker image we created above, as a base for a custom Jenkins agent image which includes nvm and all the necessary Node versions.\nExample Dockerfile:\nJenkins agent Dockerfile FROM our-company/our-nvm-base:latest # you might need to create jenkins user earlier USER jenkins ENV NODE_VERSIONS=\u0026#34;lts/* 16\u0026#34; # install Node versions RUN nvm install $NODE_VERSIONS \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ nvm use \u0026#34;lts/*\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ npm install -g yarn And that\u0026rsquo;s it! Right? \u0026#x1f914;\nWas it enough to get it working? Not really \u0026#x1f615;. Why?\nIt all depends how do you call the commands. While it works well during the build time, it may not work when running the container or calling commands in different ways.\nFor example, it may not work if you use docker exec to run commands in containers - which we do when we test Docker base images. Similar situation happen when sh commands are used in Jenkins pipelines, ~/.profile is not loaded, and so nvm.sh is not sourced properly. While it\u0026rsquo;s possible to teach users to source nvm.sh in every sh command, this can be cumbersome and error-prone. Therefore, we need a better solution.\nWhat eventually worked? After struggling with the previous approach, I started thinking of an easier and more straightforward way to work with nvm and avoid common mistakes. I wanted something that would work the same way on both my local machine and in the CI/CD environment.\nI realized that there were two main things that nvm did: managing installations of different Node versions and loading them on demand by modifying the PATH environment variable.\nWhile thinking about how to simplify this process, it occurred to me that it would be much easier if nvm was a command rather than a bash function. And then, it hit me – why not make nvm a command?\nTo do this, I created a file with the following code: First try on nvm wrapper #!/usr/bin/env bash # load nvm [ -s \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; . \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; # call nvm with all the parameters nvm $@ Next, I made this file executable and available for execution by writing it to /usr/local/bin/nvm, ~/.bin/nvm, or ~/.local/bin/nvm - whatever works for you.\nWith this solution, there was no longer any need to source nvm.sh so we could use nvm. Instead, it could be called directly as a command, which simplified and streamlined the process considerably.\nI was able to install and manage different versions of Node. However, attempting to use node or npm commands resulted in an error message stating that the command was not recognized. This is because nvm installed like that do not mangle the PATH environment variable anymore. To fix this issue, there are two potential solutions.\nThe first solution involves manually setting the PATH variable to include the desired version of Node. If you only need one specific version in your Docker image, this solution might suffice. Additionally, exposing the bin directory will automatically expose all custom binaries installed with npm.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s as easy as adding in Dockerfile of agent:\nENV PATH=$NVM_DIR/versions/node/v18.16.0/bin:$PATH The second solution involves creating wrappers for node and npm commands in the same style as the nvm command. While this approach has the downside of not automatically exposing binaries installed via npm, it is a great idea overall. By running node wrapper, we can guess which version of Node should be used by sourcing nvm and running it.\nHere are examples of the wrapper scripts for node and npm:\nWrapper script for node: Node wrapper #!/usr/bin/env bash [ -s \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; . \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; exec node $@ Wrapper script for npm: NPM wrapper #!/usr/bin/env bash [ -s \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; . \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; exec npm $@ I use exec here for node and npm but not for nvm because nvm is a function while node and npm are executables. By using exec to run them, we eliminate one layer of bash shell, which saves a few megabytes of RAM in the container.\nHow to automatically expose binaries installed by npm? The \u0026ldquo;wrappers\u0026rdquo; approach has a downside: binaries installed via npm are not immediately available. They have to be wrapped or linked, or the PATH has to be modified. But we can automate this in our script!\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an improved version of /usr/local/bin/npm:\nImproved /usr/local/bin/npm #!/usr/bin/env bash [ -s \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; . \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; set -e npm $@ if [ \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; == \u0026#34;install\u0026#34; ]; then find $(dirname $(nvm which node)) \\ -executable \\ \\( -type f -o -type l \\) \\ -print \\ | sed \u0026#39;/node$/d;/npm$/d\u0026#39; \\ | xargs -I{} ln -sf {} /usr/local/bin/ fi This script works by first executing npm $@ normally, without exec. After successful execution of npm install, it will find all the executables in the same directory as the current node executable, except for node and npm themselves, and symlink them to a directory already in the PATH, such as /usr/local/bin. Note that using /usr/local/bin will require root permissions. Alternatively, you can use ~/bin or ~/.local/bin, as long as one of these directories is in the PATH.\nWhat about npx? A colleague suggest me, that npx command should be wrapped too. I used same script as for npm but without linking after install. Final script will look like:\nExample /usr/local/bin/npx #!/usr/bin/env bash [ -s \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; . \u0026#34;$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\u0026#34; exec npx $@ Complete example I prepared example repo with Dockerfiles\u0026thinsp; external link implementing both ways + some test proving why solution with wrappers works better4.\nThis example presents a base image, which provides just NVM a top Ubuntu, without any version of Node available out of the box. You can use this base in a Docker image:\nHow to use it in the real app FROM tgagor/base-v2/nvm # copy sources COPY ./src ./ COPY .nvmrc ./ # install Node you need, set it as default, upgrade npm to latest version RUN nvm install --default --latest-npm # install your app RUN npm install ... Use those wrapper scripts in your CI/CD agents and you will be able to use NVM in the same way.\nFinal words In conclusion, managing multiple versions of Node can be a hassle, but by creating a simple wrapper script, we can make nvm a command and automate the process of exposing the correct binaries installed via npm. With these techniques, we can easily manage multiple Node versions and ensure that our development and CI/CD environments will work in the same way.\nHopefully, this article has provided some useful insights and tips for managing Node versions with nvm. Happy coding!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s pretty interesting, I review a huge part of Internet looking for solutions like this and no one does it like me. Am I wrong?

It\u0026rsquo;s a journey of constant learning, and Morgan Housel\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Psychology of Money\u0026rdquo; is one of those books I wish I had read right at the start. It’s a fantastic guide for anyone beginning their investment journey because it sets realistic expectations and helps you understand that your mindset is just as important as your strategy.\nA Summary for My Future Self At its core, the book argues that doing well with money isn\u0026rsquo;t about what you know, it\u0026rsquo;s about how you behave. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to be a genius to succeed, but you do need to be disciplined and patient. Housel breaks this down into several key ideas:\nWealth is what you don\u0026rsquo;t see: true wealth is the money you haven\u0026rsquo;t spent. It\u0026rsquo;s the financial assets that give you freedom and options. We often judge wealth by what we see - nice cars, big houses - but that\u0026rsquo;s just spending, the opposite of wealth. The power of compounding: the real magic in investing comes from letting your money grow over a long time. It’s not about chasing the highest possible returns in a single year - it’s about getting pretty good, consistent returns for decades. Getting wealthy vs. staying wealthy: getting money often requires taking risks and being optimistic. Keeping it, however, requires the opposite: humility, fear, and a healthy dose of paranoia about losing what you\u0026rsquo;ve gained. Know the goalposts: the most dangerous thing in finance is the temptation to keep pushing for more. Housel teaches the importance of knowing what \u0026ldquo;enough\u0026rdquo; means to you. Chasing endless returns without a goal is a recipe for disaster. Freedom is the ultimate goal: the highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, \u0026ldquo;I can do whatever I want today\u0026rdquo;. Money\u0026rsquo;s greatest value is the control it gives you over your time. My Personal Takeaways This book resonated with me deeply. I remember it suggesting a focus on low-cost index funds and ETFs, which takes the pressure off trying to pick individual winners. The idea is to simply capture the market\u0026rsquo;s average return. As Housel points out, it\u0026rsquo;s incredibly hard to beat the market average (like the S\u0026amp;P 500\u0026rsquo;s historical 7% annual return) over the long run, especially without dedicating your life to analysis. For most of us, owning a diversified, low-cost fund is the most reliable path to building wealth.\nI also loved the focus on the psychological side of money. It’s not just about saving for the sake of having millions when you\u0026rsquo;re old. It\u0026rsquo;s about finding a balance. The book encourages you to save for the future but also to use your money to enjoy your life today.\nI think it wasn\u0026rsquo;t in this book, but charity could also be some kind of wealth that you could collect going through your life. It\u0026rsquo;s not returning you the money, but rather the smiles and gratitude of other people, a currency on it own.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2023/the-psychology-of-money/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover-en.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eThe Psychology of Money\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eTimeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Morgan Housel\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI actually read a Polish version:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book Psychologia pieniędzy by Morgan Housel\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003ePsychologia pieniędzy\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003ePonadczasowe lekcje o bogactwie, chciwości i szczęściu\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Morgan Housel\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs an amateur investor for a few years now, I\u0026rsquo;ve had my share of ups and downs.

I already cleared all of them in my Docker images, but somehow I didn\u0026rsquo;t fix my station.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s wrong with the old /etc/apt/trusted.gpg keyring? ALL keys put there are used to verify ALL the repositories. Why it\u0026rsquo;s a problem? Because potentially someone can put in one of repositories package signed by key not supposed to be used in this specific repo.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine a real world attack but on the other side, possibility to install package that is not verified by repo key is not nice.\nSo, how to do it? First, location We have to figure out where to put those keys and I saw already few options.\n/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ It\u0026rsquo;s not a good idea as this works exactly the same way as the old single db file - authorizes all the repos with keys there. /usr/share/keyrings/ This path is ok for me, for the keys coming from official distribution, but not to add them manually there\u0026hellip; /etc/apt/keyrings/ This is my preference as it\u0026rsquo;s left in /etc close to the other repo files. It\u0026rsquo;s even already created on recent Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s. Second, file name According to Debian1, those files should be named like something-archive-keyring.asc or something-archive-keyring.ppg (although I see them more often as something-archive-keyring.gpg).\nWhy there\u0026rsquo;s a difference in the extension? It depends, if your key is armored[^amored] or not. Armored keys should use .asc extension, binary should use .gpg.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to recognize, armored files are in ASCII format and they look like:\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- ... bla bla bla here -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- Complete example Without de-armoring:\nsudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/signal-desktop-archive-keyring.asc echo \u0026#39;deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/signal-desktop-archive-keyring.asc] https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt xenial main\u0026#39; |\\ sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/signal-xenial.list With de-armoring:\nwget -O- https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt/keys.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/keyrings/signal-desktop-archive-keyring.gpg \u0026gt; /dev/null echo \u0026#39;deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/signal-desktop-archive-keyring.gpg] https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt xenial main\u0026#39; |\\ sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/signal-xenial.list Remember to verify it with:\nsudo apt update Let\u0026rsquo;s link 2.\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/UseThirdParty#OpenPGP_certificate_distribution\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttp://www.askapache.com/htaccess/apache-authentication-in-htaccess.html\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2022/10/ubuntu-key-is-stored-in-legacy-trusted.gpg-keyring.../","summary":"Learn how to resolve the \u0026ldquo;Key is stored in legacy trusted.gpg keyring\u0026rdquo; warning on Ubuntu 22.04 by properly managing GPG keys for repositories.","title":"Ubuntu - Key is stored in legacy trusted.gpg keyring..."},{"content":"IMO people don\u0026rsquo;t understand how VOLUME1 works so they don\u0026rsquo;t use it. It\u0026rsquo;s generally used far too rarely!\nIn short VOLUME means two things:\nWhatever is left in directory marked as VOLUME, stays there and can\u0026rsquo;t be changed in later layers (actually it can be changed but changes won\u0026rsquo;t be persistent). Volumes are not part of layered image FS. They\u0026rsquo;re mounted as anonymous volumes located on standard file system. This means they\u0026rsquo;re working much faster. Let me explain it a bit.\nUse VOLUME for temporary files directories That\u0026rsquo;s one of things that piss me off in the official base images . They just don\u0026rsquo;t set up volumes for temporary directories by default. That\u0026rsquo;s why in my base images I always have something like that, somewhere at beginning:\nExample Dockerfile # on Debian VOLUME [\u0026#34;/tmp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/var/tmp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/var/cache/apt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/var/lib/apt/lists\u0026#34;] # on CentOS VOLUME [\u0026#34;/tmp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/var/tmp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/var/cache/yum\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/var/cache/dnf\u0026#34;] What it does? It keeps images clean. Earlier, I was installing packages like this:\nHow everybody do it - without VOLUMEs FROM debian RUN apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt-get install -y nginx \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt-get clean \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* Debian by default saves package lists (that\u0026rsquo;s what apt-get update downloads) in /var/cache/apt/lists. Then it\u0026rsquo;s downloading deb packages to /var/cache/apt/archives and all of this rubbish will be left in image by default, unless you remove it. But by marking /var/cache/apt as a VOLUME, all content became immutable and is removed/dropped at the end of each directive (like each RUN). So I can do it right now like this:\nHow I do it - with VOLUMEs FROM debian VOLUME [\u0026#34;/tmp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/var/tmp\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/var/cache/apt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/var/lib/apt/lists\u0026#34;] RUN apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt-get install -y nginx It just makes life easier \u0026#x1f604;\nAdd clean-up task for anonymous volumes Info\nSadly, those anonymous volumes are just left after you deploy new image version or shut it down. You have to clean them from time to time!\nWhich you probably should already know, if you manage cluster of docker hosts.

I was waiting for any serious streaming provider, that will give me easy and legal access to the movies I love. Ok, looks like not to all of them were there, but future was looking bright. As time was passing, offer was extending. They eventually added even some Polish movies, which my wife appreciated. Seems like my country is not in the same league like USA, Germany or UK. Screw it! It\u0026rsquo;s still better than nothing, right?\nI prefer original audio and subtitles, but rest of my family prefer dubbing. It was all slowly propagating and right now most movies have it.\nUI is simple and responsive on all devices I use. I\u0026rsquo;m quite disappointed, that in basic plan there\u0026rsquo;s no FullHD quality and if you want 4K, you have to pay even more. Pirates just provide you a variety of resolutions, audio codecs\u0026hellip; But it\u0026rsquo;s at least legal, legal is good, right?\nWhen I started my adventure with them, I was quite satisfied. I like to watch Sci-Fi movies. I had there \u0026ldquo;The Expanse\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Star Trek Discovery\u0026rdquo; and few more. There were Marvel movies, not all of them but most.\nI also have HBO GO. I was following \u0026ldquo;Game of Thrones\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Chernobyl\u0026rdquo; and few more. Quality is not as good as on Netflix. I think it\u0026rsquo;s max FullHD, but probably some of videos are even worse. I pay for it half the price of Netflix, but I also have access to 3 FullHD TV channels. Video quality is lower, but actually movies and TV series are in my opinion of better quality. More engaging, better rated on IMDB, etc.\nTwo years passed and landscape is kinda different.\nI have now:\nNetflix HBO Go (for one third of the price of Netflix) Apple TV (half of the price of Netflix) Amazon Prime (costs ~15 times less than Netflix) Netflix was pioneering the whole market. They were fist, that provided an easy to use and legal service allowing people to watch any movie in the front of TV/PC. They even make it simpler than downloading pirate copy. No need to dig through multiple torrents and hoping that it will download. It\u0026rsquo;s all already there, ready to use.\nOthers saw their success and decided to copy it and that IMO started decline of it\u0026rsquo;s quality/value. I can\u0026rsquo;t watch \u0026ldquo;The Expanse\u0026rdquo; anymore on Netflix, it was moved to Amazon Prime. I can\u0026rsquo;t watch new season of \u0026ldquo;Star Trek\u0026rdquo; because it was moved to some \u0026ldquo;Paramount+\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure, if I can register to this service from my country right now.\nMy daughter wanted to binge watch Marvel movies during Xmas holidays, so we could catch all nuances together. We can\u0026rsquo;t. There are no Marvel movies on Netflix, just one or two on HBO Go. There\u0026rsquo;s this new Disney+, but it\u0026rsquo;s not available in my country. I can\u0026rsquo;t watch Avengers, Star Wars or even some fairy tales disappear (which my younger kids enjoy).\nOn Apple TV, I watched \u0026ldquo;The Fundation\u0026rdquo;. Not bad, but actually I don\u0026rsquo;t see anything more interesting. There are more movies and even quite fresh block busters, but buying them cost around the monthly value of Netflix. There\u0026rsquo;s also option to borrow for ~20% of Netflix monthly price. Quality of video is really good, maybe even better than on Netflix. On the other side application on my TV is not of the Apple class. It\u0026rsquo;s crappy, not intuitive. I just don\u0026rsquo;t like it. When I think about the service, I have mixed feelings. I pay, to gain access to the service so I could pay even more to watch something recent. Summing it up, I have to pay more than for Netflix or even a cinema ticket to watch something on my own TV. Streaming on mass scale, don\u0026rsquo;t cost that much like whole service in cinema. I don\u0026rsquo;t have 7.1 audio and boxes of pop-corn. Why would I pay more to buy movie like that than going to cinema?\nI have 4 paid services active right now and I\u0026rsquo;m not able to watch what I want to. It feels, like history turned the full circle and again pirates can provide higher quality of the service, giving people easy access to all the materials and you can even choose the quality you want. They might again gain the market and I can already hear yelling of corporations how they\u0026rsquo;re responsible for artists loosing their money. But is it ok, if I loose my money for 4 paid services, but can\u0026rsquo;t really get access to what I want? Is it ok, to block access to some movies in other streaming platform but do not provide legal alternative?\nI wanted a fair service, for fair amount of money. Now I feel like someone cheated me. I believe for next 2-3 years they will choke with all those new Stream+ services of smaller and lower portfolios. They won\u0026rsquo;t be profitable and people will be more and more annoyed. I hope they all will fail and eventually instead of building closed platforms, they will find way to share media in more open way.\nFor now I will share my opinion and cancel most of the subscriptions.

I use my pool to securely store backups, archive my old documents and keep huge family\u0026rsquo;s photo library.\nI have new disks. They were tortured with badblocks , so they\u0026rsquo;re ready to create ZFS pool.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read few documents about different approaches 1 2 3. I wanted to be sure if anything changed during past years. One of articles recommends mirroring over RAIDZ. Resilvering is faster, at the same time putting IO less stress on whole pool. But pool as small as mine, relies on single drive which might die in between and data won\u0026rsquo;t be recoverable. Eventually, I decided to go for RAIDZ1 for now and in the future I rather move to RAIDZ2. For that, I have to buy one more disk - Black Friday is close, we will see.\nOne thing that is available now, but was not, when I created ZFS pool last time, is encryption. I want it. I won\u0026rsquo;t be running with my PC anywhere, but in case if disk will be damaged and I will have to return it. No worries, data is unavailable. So I want it \u0026#x1f604;\nLet\u0026rsquo;s do it I use Ubuntu 21.10 but despite installation of ZFS utils, rest of commands is not Ubuntu specific and should work on any distro.\nInstall ZFS sudo apt install -y zfsutils-linux zfs-zed Encryption key First, I have to generate secure key/file, that will be used to encrypt/decrypt file system. I will keep it on my root filesystem, actually in /root directory, as it won\u0026rsquo;t be easily available for other users.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possible to use password or raw file. On laptop, I will choose password, but on my desktop PC I prefer file. First, I was thinking to place it in /etc/zfs but it\u0026rsquo;s world readable. So I decided I will drop it in /root dir.\nGenerate encryption key sudo dd if=/dev/random of=/root/.zfs-encrypt.key bs=1 count=32 I strongly advice to make backup of this key. Multiple backups actually :)\nCreate a fully encrypted pool Now I can create pool. Most examples refer to disks as sda, sdb, etc. But I prefer to use their labels as drive model plus serial number. Just check /dev/disk/by-id/. Other way is by use of wwn-* ids, they\u0026rsquo;re also stable across restarts, cable changes, etc. I strongly recommend such ids over standard letters.\nCreate encrypted ZFS pool sudo zpool create \\ -o ashift=12 \\ -o feature@encryption=enabled \\ -O encryption=on \\ -O keylocation=file:///root/.zfs-encrypt.key \\ -O keyformat=raw \\ storage raidz1 \\ ata-WDC_WD140EDGZ-11B1PA0_9MGJK4YK \\ ata-WDC_WD140EDGZ-11B1PA0_Y6GVH40C \\ ata-WDC_WD140EDGZ-11B1PA0_Y6GWHD3C What happen here?\n-o ashift=12 - treat disks sector size as 4KB, it was detected automatically but I wanted to be sure :) -o feature@encryption=enabled -O encryption=on -O keylocation=file:///root/.zfs-encrypt.key -O keyformat=raw - enable encryption on whole pool, use raw key and default encryption method: aes-256-gcm Automatically decrypt on boot So my pool is encrypted now, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to decrypt it manually each time my PC starts. So I added such service:\n/etc/systemd/system/zfs-load-key.service sudo cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF \u0026gt; /etc/systemd/system/zfs-load-key.service [Unit] Description=Load encryption keys DefaultDependencies=no After=zfs-import.target Before=zfs-mount.service [Service] Type=oneshot RemainAfterExit=yes ExecStart=/sbin/zfs load-key -a StandardInput=tty-force [Install] WantedBy=zfs-mount.service EOF It have to enabled it now:\nEnable key load service sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable zfs-load-key In ArchLinux wiki 4, you can find example for service, that can load individual key per pool, but I had trouble getting it to work. Service above loads all keys for all pools and it\u0026rsquo;s matching my case of just two pools ;)\nLet\u0026rsquo;s configure pool There are few options worth to setup just after pool creation:\nInitial pool configuration # automatically expand pool when new disk is added sudo zpool set autoexpand=on storage # automatically replace failed disk with hot spare sudo zpool set autoreplace=on storage # enable LZ4 compression sudo zfs set compression=lz4 storage # disable access time - for better performance sudo zfs set atime=off storage For better explanation of options, check best practices on Aaron\u0026rsquo;s Toponce blog 5.\nCreate datasets (actual mount points) Now I\u0026rsquo;m ready to create few datasets, that will be actually used to store files.\nCreate ZFS datasets and configure them # photos are well compressed, so I don\u0026#39;t need to compress them again sudo zfs create storage/photos sudo zfs set compression=off storage/photos # on backups I often just copy files staring, so let use stronger compression ZSTF sudo zfs create storage/backup sudo zfs set compression=zstd storage/backup # I like to keep my downloads on pool too sudo zfs create -o mountpoint=/home/timor/Downloads storage/downloads Setting TLER on boot Having disks in RAID, it\u0026rsquo;s good to have TLER enabled to rely on RAID for error recovery instead of internal hard drive recover 6.

For redundancy, in case of disk failure. I started with some crazy LVM mirrors done on two disks of different size. Sync job was starting on every boot \u0026#x1f604;\nThen came time for RAID5 on mdadm + LVM for volume management. It was working nice until the moment when disks became bigger. Long array rebuilds or checks, required my PC to stay turned on overnight just to validate if stuff works still.\nThen in work, I had my first contact with ZFS and it was love at first sight \u0026#x2764;\u0026#xfe0f; Biggest improvement was, that after creation of pool there\u0026rsquo;s no need to re-sync whole disk. Both resilvering or scrub were much faster than standard mdadm check.\nMy old disks are 2TB big and almost each of them is different now. I started with 3 x ST2000DL003 2TB, but after failure of one I was unable to buy exact replacement. Closest possible was: ST2000DM001. Since that moment, I had disks running at variable speed around 5400RPM and one on 7200RPM. I decided to add another drive to the pool as spare, it was Samsung HD204UI. After it failed, I added WDC Black WD2003FYYS 2TB.\nToday, oldest disk is around 10 years old, youngest are around 8. Just this is pretty awful but what pushed me to replace them, was actual lack of space \u0026#x1f604;\nI was hoping to find 4 x 8TB drives which will quadruple my capacity and should provide enough space and safety for years to come, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any reasonably priced offers. I even bought 4 x Toshiba X300 8TB. I started copying data to them\u0026hellip; And they started dying one by one \u0026#x1f61e; Actually, they didn\u0026rsquo;t die, but SMART was reporting \u0026ldquo;pre-fail\u0026rdquo; condition, when they were working heavily for too long. What if I have to re-sync/scrub whole pool? Will they die in the middle. I returned all of them. It was first time I gave a chance to Toshiba. It was last time \u0026#x1f609;\nThen I saw a movie on Youtube or article - someone was buying at bulk cheap external HDDs and \u0026ldquo;shucking\u0026rdquo; them 1. It was pretty close to how I understand building RAID as \u0026ldquo;Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks\u0026rdquo; \u0026#x1f609; Those disk are usually pretty good disks - either WD RED which are actually designed for NAS/RAID workload, or so called \u0026ldquo;white labels\u0026rdquo; which are just variations of HGST drives (sometimes slower, with less cache, etc).\nI noticed a promo on Amazon on WD Elements 14TB and I bought 3 of them. Wanted 4, but they were limiting orders. They were 30% cheaper than similar internal HDDs.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s inside? I connected them as they\u0026rsquo;re provided, in those plastic coffins and started playing. First I stress tested them with badblocks 2 3.\nRun badblocks badblocks -b 4096 -wsv /dev/sde After around 1 hour, all of them were quite warm. Having between 53~55°C. Theoretically those drives can operate in up to 60°C, but at the end of 2nd day, two disk turned off and I have to turn them off and on again to make them discoverable, which just reminds me:\nAs SMART didn\u0026rsquo;t notice anything worrying, I was quite sure it\u0026rsquo;s just because of temperature (coldest one stayed alive). I finished my torture testing here and decided to \u0026ldquo;shuck\u0026rdquo; them.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s really good instruction on how to do that on iFixit 4, so I won\u0026rsquo;t be explaining it here.\nI ended up having 3 new WDC WD140EDGZ-11B1PA0 14TB 5400RPM disks, with average transfers around 170~200MB/s. What\u0026rsquo;s interesting SMART recognise them as 7200RPM, but I heard it\u0026rsquo;s not worth to trust it in case of WDC/HGST drives.\nsmartctl output smartctl 7.2 2020-12-30 r5155 [x86_64-linux-5.13.0-21-generic] (local build) Copyright (C) 2002-20, Bruce Allen, Christian Franke, www.smartmontools.org === START OF INFORMATION SECTION === Device Model: WDC WD140EDGZ-11B1PA0 LU WWN Device Id: 5 000cca 2adcc7fcb Firmware Version: 85.00A85 User Capacity: 14 000 519 643 136 bytes [14,0 TB] Sector Sizes: 512 bytes logical, 4096 bytes physical Rotation Rate: 7200 rpm Form Factor: 3.5 inches Device is: Not in smartctl database [for details use: -P showall] ATA Version is: ACS-2, ATA8-ACS T13/1699-D revision 4 SATA Version is: SATA 3.2, 6.0 Gb/s (current: 6.0 Gb/s) Local Time is: Fri Nov 12 15:59:23 2021 CET SMART support is: Available - device has SMART capability.

It allows to easily determine why something was changed, etc. Makes sense, but this also means, that I should be adding this ticket to every message\u0026hellip; And this doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense for me. I will accidentally avoid it from time to time or make a lot of typos.\nI prepared little automation to handle that. I use two git aliases. One reads ticket Id from git branch, the other automatically pre-fixes all my commit messages with it. If there\u0026rsquo;s no ticket, commit will fail.\nBranch name might start with feature/, bugfix/ or hotfix/. Then comes ticket number, I guess your tickets also have format that can be easily matched with a regular expressions. Then, I like to describe branch purpose.\nI have such aliases in my ~/.gitconfig:\n~/.gitconfig # my custom aliases [alias] jira = !\u0026#34;f() { git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD | sed -n -E \u0026#39;s#^(feature|(bug|hot)-?(fix)?)/([A-Z]+-[0-9]+)[^a-zA-Z0-9].*#\\\\4#p\u0026#39; ; }; f\u0026#34; cm = !\u0026#34;f() { if echo \\\u0026#34;$1\\\u0026#34; | egrep -q \u0026#39;^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+ \u0026#39;; then git add -A \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git commit -m \\\u0026#34;$1\\\u0026#34;; else JIRA=$(git jira); if [ -z \u0026#34;$JIRA\u0026#34; ]; then echo \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 \u0026#39;#### Start message with Jira ticket number! ####\u0026#39;; exit 1; else git add -A \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git commit -m \\\u0026#34;$JIRA $1\\\u0026#34;; fi; fi; }; f\u0026#34; How to use it? Whether I use git-flow or just simple feature branching, before any commit, I always start with fresh branch: Create new branch git checkout -b feature/ABC-123-descriptive-branch-purpose My aliases read ticket from branch, so I have to provide ticket number only once - during branch creation. Then, I commit my changes like this: Commit changes git cm \u0026#34;Descriptive message\u0026#34; Result of it is: What it does git add -A git commit -m \u0026#34;ABC-123 Descriptive message\u0026#34; With this simple trick, I have to pay attention to ticket number once in a while.

Personally, I consider running yum upgrade or apt upgrade/apt dist-upgrade in Dockerfile as anti-pattern - instead builds should be running so frequently to automatically pull all new upgrades from base images. That\u0026rsquo;s theory, but with images like CentOS, you have to do it or risk running your software on unpatched and potentially unsecure system. That\u0026rsquo;s why I don\u0026rsquo;t like CentOS images as a base in general, they just suck from this perspective.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also another issue here - running those upgrades makes your image just bigger. Sometimes significantly bigger. That\u0026rsquo;s not what I expect from base images.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2021/01/how-old-are-official-docker-images/","summary":"Discover the age and update frequency of various official Docker images, and learn why it\u0026rsquo;s important to keep your base images up to date for security and performance.","title":"How old are Official Docker images?"},{"content":" ErykAuthor: Terry Pratchett\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2021/eryk/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book Eryk by Terry Pratchett\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eEryk\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Terry Pratchett\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e","title":"Eryk"},{"content":" CzarodzicielstwoAuthor: Terry Pratchett\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2021/czarodzicielstwo/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book Czarodzicielstwo by Terry Pratchett\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eCzarodzicielstwo\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Terry Pratchett\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e","title":"Czarodzicielstwo"},{"content":" MortAuthor: Terry Pratchett\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2021/mort/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book Mort by Terry Pratchett\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eMort\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Terry Pratchett\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e","title":"Mort"},{"content":" RównoumagicznienieAuthor: Terry Pratchett\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2021/rownoumagicznienie/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book Równoumagicznienie by Terry Pratchett\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eRównoumagicznienie\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Terry Pratchett\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e","title":"Równoumagicznienie"},{"content":" Blask fantastycznyAuthor: Terry Pratchett\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2021/blask-fantastyczny/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book Blask fantastyczny by Terry Pratchett\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eBlask fantastyczny\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Terry Pratchett\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e","title":"Blask fantastyczny"},{"content":" Kolor magiiAuthor: Terry Pratchett\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2021/kolor-magii/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book Kolor magii by Terry Pratchett\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eKolor magii\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Terry Pratchett\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e","title":"Kolor magii"},{"content":"I started my blog on custom (written by my) engine, but as I didn\u0026rsquo;t had enough time to enhance it I switched to Wordpress.

There were 2 main reasons for that:\nCorporations don\u0026rsquo;t like Linux - they can\u0026rsquo;t manage it, they can\u0026rsquo;t support it, so they blocked it with \u0026ldquo;Security policy\u0026rdquo;, ISO20001, or other nonsense. Actually they\u0026rsquo;re partially right but in different place - many business collaboration applications don\u0026rsquo;t work well on LInux (or they don\u0026rsquo;t work at all) Skype for Business - there\u0026rsquo;s open source alternative but to get full support you have to pay for additional codecs (as far as I remember) - it\u0026rsquo;s not working stable even in paid version Outlook and calendar support - I love Thunderbird and I use it for years, but calendar invitations didn\u0026rsquo;t work nice (honestly, they didn\u0026rsquo;t work nice even between different Outlook versions\u0026hellip;) Corporate VPN apps - Christ, I always was able to get it working eventually, but\u0026hellip; why bother I\u0026rsquo;m older, maybe lazier, maybe smarter - I don\u0026rsquo;t like to spend my time resolving problems that don\u0026rsquo;t give me any value. That\u0026rsquo;s how I switched to MacOS - for business purposes only. Privately I still prefer Linux.\nAfter the switch I\u0026rsquo;ve found some differences. Annoying stuff like different behavior of home/end buttons, etc. So right now, on every Mac that I\u0026rsquo;m working with, I\u0026rsquo;m making it to work more like Linux desktop. I\u0026rsquo;ve found those information useful to few my friends too. I decided to publish this because I received too many questions about what to do, how to start?\nIf you think I\u0026rsquo;m missing something important or I did something really bad way - please comment, I will updated it.\nHow to make screenshots (full screen/partial/desktop recording)? https://support.apple.com/pl-pl/HT201361\u0026thinsp; external link How to change screenshot save localization? By default screenshots are saved on desktop which will turn into mess quickly. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to change default save localization for created screenshots: https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-9081\u0026thinsp; external link Keyboard and keyboard shortcuts\u0026hellip; Polish keyboard layout is terrific, location of tilde and backslash buttons cause both Left Shift and Enter to be really far from normal hands position - in my case it\u0026rsquo;s causing pain in hands after few hours of use Another problem is location of Right Alt, it\u0026rsquo;s hidden deeply under hand during writing so it\u0026rsquo;s not convenient to write polish letters like ąśłóćź, etc. Maybe it will be possible to remap few keys to make this layout more usable but right now experience is terrific.\nThis is really big issue. Because on Mac Win/CMD key is used a lot switch to normal keyboard doesn\u0026rsquo;t help. Use of most common shortcuts really overload my thumbs.\nBest solutions I\u0026rsquo;ve found is Karabiner-Elements\u0026thinsp; external link . It allow to remap keys (ex. switch right alt/cmd) and you can define different options per device (internal/external keyboard). It\u0026rsquo;s also very useful to make standard PC keyboards to be mapped like Apple keyboard.\nSpecial function keys do not work from external keyboard (it\u0026rsquo;s not Mac compatible ) I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it\u0026rsquo;s possible to configure them. With Karabiner-Elements\u0026thinsp; external link it\u0026rsquo;s possible to add support for some of them.\nKeyboard shortcuts are totally different than on Windows or Linux Here you could find introduction to most typical shortcuts: https://www.apple.com/support/pages/shortcuts/body.html No other way - you have to learn them.\nFew of my favorites, I use everyday:\nCmd + Space - Spotlight search - think about it like ‘Win\u0026rsquo; key in Gnome 3, you can start writing app or file name to start/open it Ctrl + Left/Right - switch Desktop on specific screen (full screen apps use \u0026ldquo;whole desktop\u0026rdquo; so it\u0026rsquo;s easy way to see what you have there or start new empty desktop) Ctrl + Up - shows all active windows, desktops, etc. Useful if you\u0026rsquo;re searching specific window Problem with bash completion on linux boxes -bash: warning: setlocale: LC_CTYPE: cannot change locale (UTF-8) -bash: warning: setlocale: LC_CTYPE: cannot change locale (UTF-8) I solved it by marking option in iTerm2 to always set language system variables.\nBash completion do not work well on Mac, there are no completions for hosts configured in ssh_config or /etc/hosts I initially tried this one: http://davidalger.com/development/bash-completion-on-os-x-with-brew/ - it generally works but only for some common tools, ex, svn requires manual download of:\ncurl -L http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/tools/client-side/bash_completion -o /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/svn Right now I thing that Brew makes this even easier, because it\u0026rsquo;s installing a lot of bash_completion configs.\nHow to add bash completion for docker?

When I have Ansible 2.3 on Jenkins server for MacOS only version 2.2 was available. Version 2.3 will arrive but some time later. This is causing problems in compatibility of code (newer features/options on Jenkins cause problems during deployment and I\u0026rsquo;m not able to test this all on my workstation before real release). Another problem connected to that is that some command line tool on Mac have different switches than on Linux, ex. date -rfc-3339=s is not available, causing scripts to broke on Mac when working on Linux, this also makes testing harder.\nMacOS also use quite old version of bash. As a result .bashrc won\u0026rsquo;t be parsed, you have to put everything to .bash_profile which will slow down starting of each new terminal session (ex. python virtual envs can add significant delay).\nEnd/Home keys behave differently on MacOS Generally you won\u0026rsquo;t find Home/End keys on typical MacBook keyboard - by default on Mac you have Command + Right keyboard shortcut to mimic End, and Command + Left to mimic Home.\nBut\u0026hellip; by default Home/End will move you to the end of page, not line. If you want this behavior back in most of your apps you could try to change keybinding:\nOne option is to create ~/Library/KeyBindings/ and save a property list like this as ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict:\n{ \u0026#34;\\UF729\u0026#34; = moveToBeginningOfLine:; \u0026#34;\\UF72B\u0026#34; = moveToEndOfLine:; \u0026#34;$\\UF729\u0026#34; = moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:; \u0026#34;$\\UF72B\u0026#34; = moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:; } Quit and reopen applications to apply the changes. Note that DefaultKeyBinding.dict is not supported by some applications like Xcode or Firefox.\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18016/can-i-change-the-behavior-of-the-home-and-end-keys-on-an-apple-keyboard-with-num\u0026thinsp; external link I can\u0026rsquo;t use X forwarding with MacOS ssh client and Linux on second end There\u0026rsquo;s additional X11 server app that you can install on MacOS (it\u0026rsquo;s called XQuartz\u0026thinsp; external link .

It\u0026rsquo;s popular, well supported and feature complete.\nUseful key shortcuts:\nCmd + T - new tab Cmd + D - spit vertically Cmd + Shift + D - split horizontally Cmd + Opt + Left/Right/Up/Down - move between shell windows (after split) Cmd + Left/Right - prev/next tab Ctrl + Cmd + Left/Right/Up/Down - change size of windows after split How to access /opt folder and make it visible in Finder I use Homebrew\u0026thinsp; external link as a package manager on MacOS. It installs packages in /opt/homebrew and if I want to configure for example my code editor to use java or some ansible-lint from this location it\u0026rsquo;s not trivial. MacOS hides \u0026ldquo;such system paths\u0026rdquo; in file selector window. There are two approaches we can do:\nTo force Finder to show us such directories, we can run:\nEnable showing system files defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES Now we have to reinitialize the Finder, either by rebooting or right-clicking the Finder on Dock, holding Option key, then selecting Relaunch.\nIf we want to turn it off again, we use:\nDisable showing system files defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles NO And as above, relaunch Finder.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also another way, that works nicely with file selection windows. Just press Command + Shift + G, which will open a dialog box in which you can input path, like: /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk...\nhttps://macpaw.com/how-to/access-opt-folder-on-mac\u0026thinsp; external link ","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2020/01/moving-from-linux-to-macos-first-steps/","summary":"Learn about the initial steps and adjustments needed when transitioning from a Linux desktop to MacOS for business purposes, including tips on keyboard shortcuts, application compatibility, and system settings.","title":"Moving from Linux to MacOS – first steps"},{"content":" Teoria kwantowa nie gryzieAuthor: Marcus Chown\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2019/teoria-kwantowa-nie-gryzie/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book Teoria kwantowa nie gryzie by Marcus Chown\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003eTeoria kwantowa nie gryzie\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Marcus Chown\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e","title":"Teoria kwantowa nie gryzie"},{"content":" RUNY Spekulacyjne Rafała ZaorskiegoInny wymiar zarządzania kapitałem na rynku Forex\nAuthor: Barbara Triss\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read this book as a summary of Rafał\u0026rsquo;s way to trade.

The story begins with the animals on Mr. Jones\u0026rsquo;s farm overthrowing their human oppressor, inspired by the ideals of equality and freedom preached by Old Major, an elder pig. However, as the pigs take control, led by Napoleon and Snowball, the revolutionary ideals quickly become corrupted.\nThe novella explores themes of power, corruption, and betrayal, illustrating how those who seek to lead can become as oppressive as the tyrants they replaced. Orwell\u0026rsquo;s portrayal of the farm\u0026rsquo;s descent into tyranny serves as a powerful warning about the dangers of unchecked power and the ease with which propaganda can manipulate the masses.\nIn contemporary society, \u0026ldquo;Animal Farm\u0026rdquo; remains highly relevant. It highlights how political leaders and governments can use misinformation and propaganda to manipulate public perception and maintain control, a concept that resonates in today\u0026rsquo;s world of media influence and information warfare.

The story is set in a future where the Party, led by the omnipresent Big Brother, exerts absolute control over every aspect of life. The protagonist, Winston Smith, works for the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the Party\u0026rsquo;s narrative. The novel explores themes of oppression, propaganda, and the erasure of individuality.\nWhat touched me was striking similarity between Orwell\u0026rsquo;s depiction and contemporary real-world practices, that can be observed in the Chinese government\u0026rsquo;s approach to surveillance and censorship. Much like the Party in \u0026ldquo;1984,\u0026rdquo; the Chinese government employs extensive monitoring and control over its citizens, restricting freedom of expression and access to information. Orwell\u0026rsquo;s concept of \u0026ldquo;thoughtcrime,\u0026rdquo; where even thinking against the Party is punishable, parallels the Chinese government\u0026rsquo;s crackdown on dissent and enforcement of ideological conformity.\nMoreover, Orwell\u0026rsquo;s novel, though fictional, is eerily relevant in the context of modern technology and data privacy. In today\u0026rsquo;s world, people often trade their personal data to tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These companies, much like Big Brother, collect and analyze vast amounts of information about individuals, often without their explicit consent or awareness. This data is used to influence behavior, target advertising, and even sway political opinions, raising concerns about privacy and autonomy.\nIt reminds me the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where Facebook allowed the political consulting firm to harvest data from millions of users without their knowledge. This data was then used to create psychological profiles and target individuals with tailored political advertisements, potentially influencing voting behavior in elections. This incident underscores the novel\u0026rsquo;s warning about the dangers of surveillance and the manipulation of information.\n\u0026ldquo;1984\u0026rdquo; serves as a powerful warning about the dangers of unchecked power and the loss of personal freedom. It reminds us of the potential consequences of allowing governments or corporations to wield excessive control over our lives. While the story is a work of fiction, its themes resonate deeply in the context of current global issues, making it a timeless and thought-provoking read.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2018/1984/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book 1984 by George Orwell\" width=\"220\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\n            \u003cq\u003e1984\u003c/q\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: George Orwell\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;1984\u0026rdquo; by George Orwell is a dystopian novel that paints a chilling portrait of a totalitarian society under constant surveillance.

The protagonist, Winston Smith, works for the Ministry of Truth, where he alters historical records to fit the Party\u0026rsquo;s narrative.

To be honest I didn\u0026rsquo;t check what kind of security provides this encryption but it feels better than keeping password in plaintext.\nI do not want to create new user for this task - I just used debian-sys-maint user.

So let\u0026rsquo;s start with ssh_config:\nHost bastion Hostname ip.xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.or.host.name User ubuntu IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa PasswordAuthentication no ForwardAgent yes ServerAliveInterval 60 TCPKeepAlive yes ControlMaster auto ControlPath ~/.ssh/ansible-%r@%h:%p ControlPersist 15m ProxyCommand none LogLevel QUIET Host * User ubuntu IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa ServerAliveInterval 60 TCPKeepAlive yes ProxyCommand ssh -q -A ubuntu@bastion nc %h %p LogLevel QUIET StrictHostKeyChecking no Now I will describe what most important options mean. For bastion:\nUser - I\u0026rsquo;m using Ubuntu kickstarted on cloud as bastion host with it\u0026rsquo;s default user. Never use root here - you don\u0026rsquo;t need that ForwardAgent yes - we want to forward our ssh keys through bastion to destination hosts, ServerAliveInterval 60 - this is like keepalive connection, ssh will send small ping/pong packets every 60 seconds so your connection won\u0026rsquo;t hung/terminate after long time, ControlMaster auto - we will open one connection to bastion host and multiplex other ssh connections through it, connection will be opened for ControlPersist time, ControlPath - this have to be configured same way like in ansible.cfg, ProxyCommand none - we\u0026rsquo;re setting ProxyCommand for all hosts but we need it disabled for bastion,`` Default hosts configuration:\nProxyCommand ssh -q -A ubuntu@bastion nc %h %p - this is what makes all magic, it will pipe your ssh connection via bastion to destination host, StrictHostKeyChecking no - this options shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be there for production but it\u0026rsquo;s useful at beginning when you create and destroy machines few times before you test everything. Normally this will cause notifications about ssh key changes, but you\u0026rsquo;re aware of that - you just recreated those machines. I\u0026rsquo;ve found examples without netcat but was unable to get them working - this one worked for me really well.\nTo test if connections work fine use this configuration like:\nssh -F ssh_config bastion ssh -F ssh_config other.host.behind.bastion And now ansible.cfg:\n[defaults] forks=20 [ssh_connection] ssh_args = -F ./ssh_config -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=5m -o LogLevel=QUIET control_path = ~/.ssh/ansible-%%r@%%h:%%p pipelining=True Most important section here is in ssh_args where we\u0026rsquo;re pointing to ssh_config file in current dir with -F option. I also have to reenter configuration for multiplexing here - it wasn\u0026rsquo;t working with ssh only configuration. control_path option have to use same paths like ssh_config (% signs are escaped with %%).\nYou should be able to run ansible/ansible-playbook commands normally now - all traffic will be forwarded through bastion.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good time now to install fail2ban on bastion and maybe reconfigure it to run ssh on crazy high port 🙂\nSources http://alexbilbie.com/2014/07/using-ansible-with-a-bastion-host/\u0026thinsp; external link http://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/12/24/running-ansible-through-ssh-bastion-host/\u0026thinsp; external link https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Multiplexing\u0026thinsp; external link ","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2016/04/use-bastion-host-with-ansible/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhen you deploy your application in cloud you don\u0026rsquo;t need and don\u0026rsquo;t want your hosts exposed via SSH to the world.

Grafana ).\nCache static and dynamic content Setting caching static and dynamic content strategy may offload your server from additional load from repetitive downloads of same, rarely updated files. This will make your site to load faster for frequent visitors.\nExample configuration:\nlocation ~* ^.+\\.(?:jpg|png|css|gif|jpeg|js|swf|m4v)$ { access_log off; log_not_found off; tcp_nodelay off; open_file_cache max=500 inactive=120s; open_file_cache_valid 45s; open_file_cache_min_uses 2; open_file_cache_errors off; expires max; } For additional performance gain, you may:\ndisable logging for static files, disable tcp_nodelay option - it\u0026rsquo;s useful to send a lot of small files (ideally smaller than single TCP packet - 1,5Kb), but images are rather big files and sending them all together will gain better performance, play with open_file_cache - it will take off some IO load, add long long expires. Caching dynamic content is harder case. There are articles that are rarely updated and they may lay in cache forever but other pages are pretty dynamic and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be cached for long. Even if caching dynamic content sounds scary for you it\u0026rsquo;s not. So called micro caching (caching for short period of time, like 1s) - is great solution for digg effect\u0026thinsp; external link or slashdotting\u0026thinsp; external link .\nLet say your page gets ten views per second and you will cache ever site for 1s, then you will be able to server 90% of requests from cache. Leaving precious CPU cycles for other tasks.\nCompress data On your page you should use filetypes that are efficiently compressed like: JPEG, PNG, MP3, etc. But all HTML, CSS, JS may be compressed too on the fly by web server, just enable options like that globally:\ngzip on; gzip_vary on; gzip_disable \u0026#34;msie6\u0026#34;; gzip_comp_level 1; gzip_proxied any; gzip_buffers 16 8k; gzip_min_length 50; gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/x-javascript application/javascript text/javascript application/atom+xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/xml image/x-icon text/x-js application/xhtml+xml image/svg+xml; You may also precompress these files stronger during build/deploy process and use gzip_static module to serve them without additional overhead for compression. Ex.:\ngzip_static on; Then use script like this to compress files:\nfind /var/www -iname *.js -print0 |xargs -0 -I\u0026#39;{}\u0026#39; sh -c \u0026#39;gzip -c9 \u0026#34;{}\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;{}.gz\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; touch -r \u0026#34;{}\u0026#34; \u0026#34;{}.gz\u0026#34;\u0026#39; find /var/www -iname *.css -print0 |xargs -0 -I\u0026#39;{}\u0026#39; sh -c \u0026#39;gzip -c9 \u0026#34;{}\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;{}.gz\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; touch -r \u0026#34;{}\u0026#34; \u0026#34;{}.gz\u0026#34;\u0026#39; Files have to had same timestamp like original (not compressed) file to be used by Nginx.\nOptimize SSL/TLS New optimized versions of HTTP protocols like HTTP/2 or SPDY require HTTPS configuration (at least in browsers implementation). Then SSL/TLS high cost of every new HTTPS connection became crucial case for further optimizations.\nThere are few steps required for improved SSL/TLS performance.\nEnable SSL session caching Use ssl_session_cache directive to cache parameters used when securing each new connection, ex.:\nssl_session_cache builtin:1000 shared:SSL:10m; Enable SSL session tickets Tickets store information about specific SSL/TLS connection so connection may be reused without new handshake, ex.:\nssl_session_tickets on; Configure OCSP stapling for SSL This will lower handshaking time by caching SSL/TLS certificate informations. This is per site/certificate configuration, ex.:\nssl_stapling on; ssl_stapling_verify on; ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/my_site_cert.crt; ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/my_site_key.key; ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/authority_cert.pem; A ssl_trusted_certificate file have to point to trusted certificate chain file - root + intermediate certificates (this can be downloaded from your certificate provider site (sometimes you have to merge by yourself those files).\nExcessive article in this topic could be found here: https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/OCSP_Stapling_on_nginx.html\u0026thinsp; external link Implement HTTP/2 or SPDY If you have HTTPS configured the only thing you have to do is to add two options on listen directive, ex.:\nlisten 443 ssl http2; # currently http2 is preferred against spdy; # on SSL enabled vhost ssl on; You may also advertise for HTTP connection that you have newer protocol available, for that on HTTP connections use this header:\nadd_header Alternate-Protocol 443:npn-spdy/3; SPDY and HTTP/2 protocols use:\nheaders compression, single, multiplexed connection (carrying pieces of multiple requests and responses at the same time) rather than multiple connection for every piece of web page. After SPDY or HTTP/2 implementation you no longer need typical HTTP/1.1 optimizations like:\ndomain sharding, resource (JS/CSS) merging, image sprites. Tune other nginx performance options Access logs Disable access logs were you don\u0026rsquo;t need them, ex.: for static files. You may also use buffer and flush options with access_log directive, ex.:\naccess_log /var/log/nginx/access.log buffer=1m flush=10s; With buffer Nginx will hold that much data in memory before writing it to disk. flush tells Nginx how often it should write gathered logs to disk.\nProxy buffering Turning proxy buffering\u0026thinsp; external link may impact performance of your reverse proxy.\nNormally when buffering is disabled, Nginx will pass response directly to client synchronously.\nWhen buffering is enable it will store response in memory set by proxy_buffer_size option and if response is too big it will be stored in temporary file.\nproxy_buffering on; proxy_buffer_size 16k; Keepalive for client and upstream connections] Every new connection costs some time for handshake and will add latency to requests. By using keepalive connections will be reused without this overhead.\nFor client connections\u0026thinsp; external link :\nkeepalive_timeout = 120s; For upstream connections\u0026thinsp; external link :\nupstream web_backend { server 127.0.0.1:80; server 10.0.0.2:80; keepalive 32; } Limit connections to some resources Some time users/bots overload your service by querying it to fast. You may limit allowed connections\u0026thinsp; external link to protect your service in such case, ex.:\nlimit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=owncloud:1m; server { # ... limit_conn owncloud 10; # ... } Adjust woker count Normally Nginx will start with only 1 worker process\u0026thinsp; external link , you should adjust this variable to at the number of CPU\u0026rsquo;s, in case of quad core CPU use in main section:\nworker_processes 4; Use socket sharding In latest kernel and Nginx versions (at least 1.9.1) there is new feature of sockets sharding. This will offload management of new connections to kernel. Each worker will create a socket listener and kernel will assign new connections to them as they become available.\nlisten 80 reuseport; Thread pools Thread pools\u0026thinsp; external link are solution for mostly long blocking IO operations that may block whole Nginx event queue (ex. when used with big files or slow storage).\nlocation / { root /storage; aio threads; } This will help a lot if you see many Nginx processes in D state, with high IO wait times.\nTune Linux for performance Backlog queue If you could see on your system connection that appear to be staling then you have to increase net.core.somaxconn. This system parameter describes the maximum number of backlogged sockets. Default is 128 so setting this to 1024 should be no big deal on any decent machine.\necho \u0026#34;net.core.somaxconn=1024\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/sysctl.conf sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf File descriptors If your system is serving a lot of connections you may get reach system wide open descriptor limit. Nginx uses up to two descriptors for each connection. Then you have to increase sys.fs.fs_max.\necho \u0026#34;sys.fs.fs_max=3191256\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/sysctl.conf sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf Ephemeral ports Nginx used as a proxy creates temporary (ephemeral) ports for each upstream server. On busy proxy servers this will result in many connection in TIME_WAIT state.\nSolution for that is to increase range of available ports by setting net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range.

I prefer to configure MySQL database (create user, database, grant permissions to user):\n[database] type = mysql host = 127.0.0.1:3306 name = grafana user = grafana password = mydbpassword So Grafana should be running on port 3000 by default, now it\u0026rsquo;s time to connect ex.: http://localhost:3000 (use your host).

In default configuration Apache don\u0026rsquo;t have such module but similar functionality could be achieved with few custom rewirtes.\nBasically we will start with these rewrites to serve gzipped CSS/JS files if they exist and the client accepts gzip compression:\nRewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-encoding} gzip RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\\.gz -s RewriteRule ^(.*)\\.(js|css)$ $1\\.$2\\.gz [QSA] Then we need to setup proper content types for such compressed files - I know how to do this in two ways:\npure rewrites with mod_header - witch should serve correct content type and prevent mod_deflate to gzip files that are already gzipped RewriteRule \\.css\\.gz$ - [T=text/css,E=no-gzip:1,E=manualgzip:1] RewriteRule \\.js\\.gz$ - [T=text/javascript,E=no-gzip:1,E=manualgzip:1] \u0026lt;ifmodule mod_headers.c\u0026gt; # setup this header only if rewrites above were used Header set Content-Encoding \u0026#34;gzip\u0026#34; env=manualgzip \u0026lt;/ifmodule\u0026gt; by using Files clause (we could add this globally in httpd.conf) \u0026lt;files *.css.gz\u0026gt; ForceType text/css Header set Content-Encoding \u0026#34;gzip\u0026#34; \u0026lt;/files\u0026gt; \u0026lt;files *.js.gz\u0026gt; #ForceType text/javascript # lately this one is more popular ForceType application/javascript Header set Content-Encoding \u0026#34;gzip\u0026#34; \u0026lt;/files\u0026gt; Both ways work fine. First one sets no-gzip variable to bypass second time compression. Second one rely on such option in my mod_deflate\u0026rsquo;s config:\nSetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \\.(?:exe|t?gz|zip|bz2|sit|rar|gz)$ no-gzip dont-vary which won\u0026rsquo;t compress any gz file, and this is why I have to setup Content-Encoding to gzip manually.\nIn both cases you will end with javacript and CSS files served from earlier prepared precomressed versions, with proper content type without engaging mod_deflate regardless you use js/css or js.gz/css.gz extension. But I strongly suggest to use extensions without gz - you will be able to disable this mechanism without any change in website code.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to prepare files just look here.\nP.S.\nI found another similar but BAD example - it\u0026rsquo;s using AddEncoding clause to add gzip content type to ALL gzip files - this will cause problems with other compressed files with gz extension ex. tar.gz. Don\u0026rsquo;t do this.

Jaja polegały na tym że po ustawieniu smtpd_delay_reject=yes wszystko wracało do normy\u0026hellip; Ale nie chciałem tego tak zostawić.\nOlśniło mnie dopiero po chwili - przecież połączenia SSL SMTP odbywają się na inny port - zdefiniowany w master.cf - może coś tam bruździ. A tutaj od razu rzuciła mi się w oczy różnica w konfiguracji dla usługi submission i ssmtp:\nsubmission inet n - - - - smtpd ... -o smtpd_sender_restrictions=reject_sender_login_mismatch,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject ... smtps inet n - - - - smtpd ... -o smtpd_client_restrictions=permit_sasl_authenticated,reject ... Submission ustawiałem niedawno i widocznie trafiłem na lepszego FAQ\u0026rsquo;a \u0026#x1f603; Wygląda na to że sprawdzanie autoryzacji SASL w smtpd_client_restrictions odbywało się w tym przypadku zanim klient się autoryzował (albo było jakieś lekkie opóźnienie). Zamiana smtpd_client_restrictions na smtpd_sender_restrictions załatwiło sprawę. Przy okazji zauważyłem że po SSL\u0026rsquo;u można było spooflować innych użytkowników co również postanowiłem szybko naprawić. A wszystko dlatego że zachciało mi się \u0026ldquo;wczesnych optymalizacji\u0026rdquo; i chciałem w tych usługach pominąć część checków, które mam w main.cf.\nW minimalnej wersji konfiguracja w master.cf powinna wyglądać tak:\nsubmission inet n - - - - smtpd -o smtpd_tls_security_level=encrypt -o smtpd_tls_auth_only = yes -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes smtps inet n - - - - smtpd -o smtpd_tls_wrappermode=yes -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes P.S.

Kilka rzeczy udało mi się całkiem fajnie w nim skonfigurować i postanowiłem zebrać te przykłady by następnym razem gdy postanowię do nich sięgnąć nie musieć wertować konfigów po serwerach \u0026#x1f603;\nSłowo wstępu Niektóre rewrite\u0026rsquo;y kończą się znakiem ? - czemu?\nOtóż Nginx próbuje automatycznie dodawać parametry na końcu przepisanego adresu. Jeśli jednak wykorzystamy zmienną $request_uri to ona sama w sobie zawiera już parametry zapytania (czyli to co w URI znajduje się po znaku ?) i właśnie dodanie pytajnika tuż za tą zmienną powoduje że argumenty nie są dublowane.\nMa to też zastosowanie gdy chcemy by rewrite kierował np. na główną stronę beż żadnych dodatkowych argumentów (zostaną one obcięte).\nWięcej na ten temat można znaleźć w dokumentacji Nginx\u0026thinsp; external link .\nInna warta wspomnienia uwaga dotyczy drobnej optymalizacji, o której warto pamiętać na etapie tworzenia rewrite\u0026rsquo;ów (można znaleźć masę kiepskich przykładów w sieci): na początku najlepiej jest stworzyć coś co działa (i przy małym ruchu może to być wystarczające) a później optymalizować - moje przykłady starałem się zoptymalizować według zalecanych praktyk.\nDlatego zamiast pisać:\nrewrite ^(.*)$ $scheme://www.domain.com$1 permanent; lepiej napisać:\nrewrite ^ $scheme://www.domain.com$request_uri? permanent; (nie wykorzystujemy przechowywania wartości dopasowania - mniejsze zużycie pamięci i lżejsza interpretacja REGEXP\u0026rsquo;a).\nA jeszcze lepiej napisać:\nreturn 301 $scheme://www.domain.com$request_uri; (w ogóle nie wykorzystujemy REGEXP\u0026rsquo;ów praktycznie zerowy narzut na przetwarzanie) - dzięki za uwagę: lukasamd.\nPrzekierowanie starej domeny na nową server { listen 80; server_name old-domain.com www.old-domain.com; return 301 $scheme://www.new-domain.com$request_uri; # rewrite ^ $scheme://www.new-domain.com$request_uri? permanent; # or # rewrite ^ $scheme://www.new-domain.com? permanent; } Wykorzystanie return w tej sytuacji jest nieco bardziej optymalne gdyż nie angażuje w ogóle silnika REGEXP a w tej sytuacji jest wystarczające.\nPierwsza linia z rewrite i $request_uri spowoduje przepisywanie też parametrów wywołań do nowej lokalizacji co jest jak najbardziej sensowne gdy pomimo domeny nie zmieniła się zbytnio struktura strony.\nJeśli strona jednak się zmieniła to możemy zdecydować o przekierowaniu bez parametrów - po prostu na główną stronę - i to robi druga linia.\nW obu przypadkach parametr permanent nakazuje użycie kodu przekierowania HTTP 301 (Moved Permanently), co ułatwi zorientowanie się crawlerom że ta zmiana jest już na stałe.\nDodanie WWW na początku domeny server { listen 80; server_name domaim.com; return 301 $scheme://www.domain.com$request_uri; #rewrite ^ $scheme://www.domain.com$request_uri? permanent; # or #rewrite ^(.*)$ $scheme://www.domain.com$1 permanent; } Przykład zakomentowany jest według dokumentacji mniej optymalny ale również zadziała. Reszta jest prosta i samoopisująca się \u0026#x1f603;\nA to jeszcze bardziej ogólna wersja dla wielu domen:\nserver { listen 195.117.254.80:80; server_name domain.pl domain.eu domain.com; return 301 $scheme://www.$http_host$request_uri; #rewrite ^ $scheme://www.$http_host$request_uri? permanent; } Ta wersja wykorzystuje zmienną $http_host do przekierowania na domenę z zapytania (zmienna ta zawiera też numer portu jeśli jest niestandardowy np. 8080, w przeciwieństwie do zmiennej $host, która zawiera tylko domenę).\nUsunięcie WWW z początku domeny server { listen 80; server_name www.domain.com; return 301 $scheme://domain.com$request_uri; #rewrite ^ $scheme://domain.com$request_uri? permanent; } Czasami może się przydać jeszcze inny kawałek, gdy strona działa na wielu domenach i chcemy przekierować wszystkie:\nserver { server_name www.domain.com _ ; # server_name www.domain1.com www.domain2.com www.domain3.eu www.domain.etc.com; if ($host ~* www\\.(.*)) { set $pure_host $1; return 301 $scheme://$pure_host$request_uri; #rewrite ^ $scheme://$pure_host$request_uri? permanent; #rewrite ^(.*)$ $scheme://$pure_host$1 permanent; } } Choć to podejście nie jest zalecane (pomimo zwięzłości). Lepiej zdefiniować dwa bloki server z domenami www.* i domenami bez www na początku. Ale z drugiej strony to cholernie wygodne\u0026hellip; \u0026#x1f603;\nPrzekierowanie \u0026ldquo;pozostałych\u0026rdquo; zapytań na domyślną domenę server { listen 80 default; server_name _; rewrite ^ $scheme://www.domena.com; #rewrite ^ $scheme://www.domena.com/search/$host; } To bardzo przydatny przykład - czyli domyślny vhost, który \u0026ldquo;przyjmie\u0026rdquo; wszystkie zapytania do domen nie zdefiniowanych w konfiguracji i przekieruje na naszą \u0026ldquo;główną stronę\u0026rdquo;.\nZakomentowany przykład jest nieco bardziej przekombinowany bo próbuje wykorzystać wyszukiwarkę na naszej stronie do wyszukania \u0026ldquo;czegoś\u0026rdquo; pomocnego - z tym przykładem należy uważać bo jeśli do serwera trafi dużo błędnych zapytań to może zostać przeciążony \u0026ldquo;bzdetnymi\u0026rdquo; wyszukiwaniami.\nPrzekierowanie pewnych podstron po zmianie struktury strony server { listen 80; server_name www.domain.com; location / { try_files $uri $uri/ @rewrites; } location @rewrites { rewrite /tag/something $scheme://new.domain.com permanent; rewrite /category/hobby /category/painting permanent; # etc ... rewrite ^ /index.php last; } } Im starsza strona tym więcej zbiera się linków, których po prostu nie można usunąć, a które z racji wprowadzonych zmian nie mają prawa bytu w nowym układzie. Warto je przekierować w nowe miejsca, lub najbardziej odpowiadające/bliskie tym starym. Problemem może się wkrótce stać duża lista przekierowań, która zaciemni konfigurację.\nPowyższy sposób w dość optymalny sposób porządkuje takie przekierowania - najpierw sprawdza czy przypadkiem nie próbujemy pobrać istniejących plików, jeśli nie to wrzuca nas nas na listę przekierowań, a jeśli i tu nic nie znajdzie to zapytanie przekazywane jest do głównego skryptu strony.\nPrzekierowanie w zależności od wartości parametru w URI if ($args ~ producent=toyota){ rewrite ^ $scheme://toyota.domena.com$request_uri? permanent; } To rzadko stosowane przekierowanie a w dodatku mało czytelnie i ponoć mało wydajne\u0026hellip; Ale potrafi być bardzo przydatne gdy chcemy przepisać adres w zależności od wartości parametru np. gdy pewna podstrona doczeka się rozbudowy w zupełnie nowym serwisie lub gdy chcemy ładnie przekierować adresy ze starej strony na nową.\nBlokowanie dostępu do ukrytych plików location ~ /\\. { access_log off; log_not_found off; deny all; } Przyznaję - to nie rewrite\u0026hellip; Ale ta linijka jest równie przydatna - pozwala zablokować możliwość pobierania ukrytych plików (np. .htaccess\u0026rsquo;ów po konfiguracji z Apachego).\nWyłączenie logowania dla robots.txt i favicon.ico location = /favicon.ico { try_files /favicon.ico =204; access_log off; log_not_found off; } location = /robots.txt { try_files /robots.txt =204; access_log off; log_not_found off; } To też nie rewrite - ale bardzo fajnie obsługuje sytuację gdy mamy i gdy nie mamy powyższych dwóch pliczków. Po pierwsze wyłącza logowanie i serwuje je gdy są dostępne. Gdy nie istnieją to serwuje puste pliki (kod 204) dzięki czemu nie przeszkadzają nam 404-ki \u0026#x1f603;\nBlokowanie dostępu do obrazków dla nieznanych referererów location ~* ^.+\\.(?:jpg|png|css|gif|jpeg|js|swf)$ { # definiujemy poprawnych refererow valid_referers none blocked *.domain.com domain.com; if ($invalid_referer) { return 444; } expires max; break; } Zabezpieczenie warte tyle co nic bo banalne do ominięcia - ale jeśli zdarzy się że ktoś postanowi wykorzystać grafikę z naszej stronki np. w aukcji na allegro czy własnym sklepie to tą prostą sztuczką możemy go przyciąć i przeważnie jest to wystarczające.\nMuszę też zaznaczyć szczególne znaczenie wartości kodu błędu 444 w Nginx\u0026rsquo;ie - powoduje on zerwanie połączenia bez wysyłania jakiejkolwiek odpowiedzi. Jeśli nie chcemy być tak okrutni to możemy użyć innego kodu, np.: 403 albo 402\u0026thinsp; external link \u0026#x1f603;\nPrzekierowanie ciekawskich w \u0026ldquo;ciemną dupę\u0026rdquo; location ~* ^/(wp-)?admin(istrator)?/? { rewrite ^ http://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/$remote_addr redirect; } Ten prosty redirect odwodzi wielu amatorów zbyt głębokiego penetrowania naszej strony\u0026hellip; A pozostałych na pewno rozbawi \u0026#x1f603;\nInne przykłady konfiguracji na mojej stronie:\nNginx - hide server version and name in Server header and error pages Nginx - kompresowanie plików dla gzip_static Nginx - konfiguracja pod WordPress’a Nginx - ustawienie domyślnego vhosta Nginx - mój domyślny config Źródła http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/useful-rewrites-for-nginx/\u0026thinsp; external link http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpRewriteModule\u0026thinsp; external link ","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2013/09/nginx-przydatne-rewritey-i-rozne-sztuczki/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePolubiłem Nginx\u0026rsquo;a i wykorzystuję go na coraz więcej sposobów.

Skrypcik działał z dwa lata na mojej poprzedniej stronie i nie raz zdarzyło się tam jakiejś mendzie zapętlić. Jakoś nie miałem czasu od razu, a później zapomniałem wrzucić go na nową stronie i tak zostało - na pewien czas.\nNiedawno przeglądając logi zauważyłem że jakieś spam-boty jednak tęsknią za tą podstroną i postanowiłem ją wskrzesić.\nPomysł jest prosty i polega na generowaniu na pewnej podstronie dużej ilości \u0026ldquo;z dupy\u0026rdquo; maili. Oczywiście w robots.txt dajemy Disallow dla tej ścieżki i jeśli bot jest kulturalny to nie będzie tam zaglądał. Crawlery spamerów przeważnie kulturalne nie są więc tam wpadną i się zapętlą zapychając sobie bazę śmieciami - taka baza traci wartość dla klientów spamera, więc przeważnie skutkuje to dodaniem naszej strony na spamerską \u0026ldquo;black listę - nie crawlować\u0026rdquo;. Dla mnie cool \u0026#x1f603; (w rzadszych przypadkach spamer może chcieć się zemścić\u0026hellip;).\nJeżeli ktoś będzie zainteresowany to mogę udostępnić skrypcik (ma postać szablonu strony dla WordPress\u0026rsquo;a) - choć zachęcam do samodzielnego napisania własnego - zawsze trudniej będzie spamerom z automatu go przeskoczyć (jak np. antyspam.pl). Należy przy tym zwrócić uwagę na kilka rzeczy:\nnie zrób sobie kuku - nie generuj fake emaili dla własnych, istniejących domen (bo może się okazać że któryś spamer jednak spróbuje wysłać te setki tysięcy błędnych maili i zrobić Ci DDOS\u0026rsquo;a zabijając serwer błędnie nadanymi mailami), nie rób innym kuku - nie generuj fake maili w cudzych domenach (no chyba że w domenach Canadian Pharmacy), jeżeli jednak nadal upierasz się przy istniejącej domenie (np. by śledzić statystyki zapytań\u0026hellip;) to ustaw rekord MX na hosta z IP 127.0.0.1 - jak dobrze pójdzie spamer sam sobie zrobi DOS\u0026rsquo;a (spodziewałbym się jednak w takiej sytuacji odwetu) :simple_smile: Źródło szablonu Paczkę z szablonem można pobrać tutaj.\nPaczka zawiera plik havefun_template.php, który należy umieścić w katalogu szablonu WordPress\u0026rsquo;a. Ja wykorzystałem w generatorze wp_post z WordPress\u0026rsquo;a - zmodyfikowania zapytania dla innej bazy nie powinno być zbyt trudne. Samo zapytanie nieco zoptymalizowałem przez co zwraca mniej losowe wyniki (zwraca losowy blok n wierszy z tabeli a nie całkiem losowe elementy) co dla potrzeb tego skryptu jest całkiem OK. Jeżeli pomysł z bazą się nie podoba (bo np. może generować zbyt duże obciążenie) to proponuję wyszukać sobie jakiś generator Lorem ipsum\u0026hellip;\nMiłej zabawy.\nBawiąc się ostatnio nowym szablonem Twenty Thirteen przygotowałem nową wersję pliku havefun_template.php dla tego szablonu.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2012/12/jak-dokuczac-spamerom/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDawno, dawno temu\u0026hellip; Za górami, za lasami\u0026hellip; czytałem sobie \u003ca title=\"Jak zapchać bazę spamerom\" href=\"http://www.lemat.priv.pl/index.php?m=page\u0026pg_id=12\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etekst Lemat\u0026rsquo;a\u003c/a\u003e o dokuczaniu spamerom i pomyślałem że sam też tak mogę i nawet chcę więc popełniłem skrypcik, który dla losowych słów generował maile.

A że obecnie standardem jest ładowanie przez stronki np. jQuery, paru pluginów do niego, jQueryUI, masy CSS\u0026rsquo;ów, itd - to na prawdę jest co kompresować \u0026#x1f603;\nDodatkowa zaleta tego rozwiązania jest taka, że o ile w przypadku kompresji online raczej kompresujemy na niskich poziomach by nieco zmniejszyć dane a równocześnie nie zabijać CPU - to w przypadku kompresji pod ten moduł możemy raz na jakiś czas \u0026ldquo;przejechać\u0026rdquo; pliki maksymalną kompresją by były jeszcze mniejsze (zaoszczędzi to nieco pasma i równocześnie przyspieszy ładowanie strony bo jest mniej do pobrania).\nPrekompresję wybranych typów plików można przeprowadzić np. tak:\nfind /var/www -iname *.js -print0 |xargs -0 -I\u0026#39;{}\u0026#39; sh -c \u0026#39;gzip -c9 \u0026#34;{}\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;{}.gz\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; touch -r \u0026#34;{}\u0026#34; \u0026#34;{}.gz\u0026#34;\u0026#39; find /var/www -iname *.css -print0 |xargs -0 -I\u0026#39;{}\u0026#39; sh -c \u0026#39;gzip -c9 \u0026#34;{}\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;{}.gz\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; touch -r \u0026#34;{}\u0026#34; \u0026#34;{}.gz\u0026#34;\u0026#39; gzip skompresuje a touch zadba by timestampy obu plików były takie same (co jest zalecaną praktyką przy wykorzystaniu tego modułu). Dwa powyższe polecenia można odpalić praktycznie w ciemno na obecnie serwowanej stronie i nie powinny spowodować zbyt dużego chaosu\u0026hellip; Trzeba pamiętać jedynie by zostały uruchomione z użytkownika, który ma dostęp do zapisu w danym vhoście i by serwer WWW miał dostęp do tak utworzonego pliku.\nZ moich obserwacji wynika że gdy timestamp pliku bez gz jest nowszy niż wersji skompresowanej to serwowana jest ta świeższa wersja ale wtedy już z ewentualną kompresją online.\nMocniejsze kompresowanie plików PNG Może nie do końca w temacie tego posta ale bardzo często gdy stosuję gzip_static_module to optymalizuję też PNG\u0026rsquo;i. Pliki PNG są kompresowane w sposób bezstratny ale przeważnie programy graficzne nie zapisują ich w najmniejszej możliwej postaci bo trwałoby to zbyt długo. Można użyć do tego celu narzędzi takich jak: optipng lub pngcrush. A poniżej odpowiedni one-liner by skompresować wszystkie PNG\u0026rsquo;i w serwisach WWW:\nfind /var/www -iname *.png -print0 |xargs -0 optipng -quiet -preserve -o7 Uwaga! Wywołanie tego skryptu może potrwać bardzo długo i z tego powodu raczej nie nadaje się do umieszczenia w cronie. Jednak ręczne puszczenie po dużych zmianach w serwisie lub z filtrem w find by kompresowane były tylko nowsze pliki będzie OK.\nOptymalizowanie plików JPG/JPEG Co prawda pliki JPG/JPEG kompresują się stratnie ale możne je nieco zoptymalizować np. usuwając niepotrzebne dane z nagłówków i zamieniając na progresywne. Możemy do tego wykorzystać takie polecenie:\nfind /var/www -iname \u0026#39;*.jpg\u0026#39; -print0 | xargs -0 -I\u0026#39;{}\u0026#39; sh -c \u0026#39;jpegtran -optimize -progressive -copy none -outfile \u0026#34;{}\u0026#34; \u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;\u0026#39; ","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2012/12/nginx-kompresowanie-plikow-dla-gzip_static/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpGzipStaticModule\"  target=\"_blank\"\u003eRuski serwer WWW\u003cspan style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\u003e\u0026thinsp;\u003csvg\n            style=\"height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;\" focusable=\"false\" data-prefix=\"fas\" data-icon=\"external-link-alt\"\n            class=\"svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\n            viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\"\u003e\n            \u003ctitle\u003eexternal link\u003c/title\u003e\n            \u003cpath fill=\"currentColor\"\n                d=\"M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z\"\u003e\n            \u003c/path\u003e\n        \u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\n ma przydatną funkcję serwowania wersji plików skompresowanych gzip\u0026rsquo;em - przez co możemy plik skompresować raz i będzie on serwowany klientom obsługującym kompresję HTTP ale już bez każdorazowego kompresowania go.

Testowałem różne długości łańcuchów i zauważyłem że zwiększanie długości łańcucha bardzo szybko powoduje znaczne zwiększenie ilości kolizji, co drastycznie obniżało wydajność (nie wspominając o czasie potrzebnym na wygenerowanie całej tablicy). Z tego powodu ostateczna implementacja choć była rzeczywiście tęczową tablicą działała bardziej jak tablica hashy - bo łańcuchy były bardzo krótkie. Ponadto ze statystyk wynikało że bardzo rzadko hasła były odzyskiwane ze środka łańcucha - zdecydowana większość trafień pochodziła z pierwszego hasła w łańcuchu. Pierwsze hasło było przeważnie słownikowe, plus czasem jakiś dodatek w postaci cyfry/zmienionej wielkości liter, itp. Pozostałe hasła w łańcuchu były praktycznie losowe.\nNa dobrą sprawę takie wyniki można wytłumaczyć od dawna znaną prawdą: \u0026ldquo;ludzie nie używają skomplikowanych haseł\u0026rdquo;. Pomyślałem więc że dużo lepiej byłoby generować hashe ze słów, które są potencjalnie prawdopodobnymi hasłami a nie dla różnych losowych śmieci. Szczególnie można by wykorzystać pewne złe nawyki powielane przez wiele osób, np. typowe \u0026ldquo;skomplikowane\u0026rdquo; hasło zaczyna się od dużej litery, później jest kilka małych, a na końcu cyfra lub dwie - przy czym ciąg liter jest wyrazem słownikowym. Tego typu wzorców jest wiele i pomyślałem że można by to wykorzystać. Na dobrą sprawę jeżeli zamierzamy sprawdzić jakość haseł z jakiejś aplikacji to nie potrzebujemy 100% trafień, wystarczy że 20% to hasła kiepskiej jakości i te będą wymagały poprawienia.\nCzym są hybrydowe tęczowe tablice? Gdy zacząłem drążyć temat trafiłem na artykuł opisujący podejście, o którym myślałem. Klasyczne tęczowe tablice \u0026ldquo;wychodzą\u0026rdquo; od pewnego hasła, z którego generujemy hash, redukujemy go do nowego losowego hasła itd\u0026hellip; Zapisujemy pierwsze hasło i ostatni hash a resztę da się odtworzyć gdy będzie potrzebna. Hybrydowe tęczowe tablice mają bardziej rozbudowaną funkcję redukującą - nie tworzy ona całkiem losowych haseł, ale hasła wygenerowane przez sklejenie słów które potencjalnie częściej powinny w hasłach występować. Czyli zamiast generować hasła typu: L;adfa=2ja, tworzone są hasła: abc123, Qwert, Bezpieczne5, itd.\nOba podejścia mają swoje zalety i wady: odpowiednio duże tęczowe tablice mogą przechować większość haseł z danego zakresu - ale będą też przechowywać masę pseudolosowych śmieciowych haseł, których prawdopodobieństwo wykorzystanie jest małe. Hybrydy przechowują dużo mniejszy zakres haseł ale za to takich \u0026ldquo;stosunkowo prawdopodobnych\u0026rdquo;, więc mniejsza tablica powinna dawać równie dobre wyniki (dla prostych zestawów haseł).\nKoncepcja okazała się znaną ale nie wykorzystywaną równie często jak tęczowe tablice. Cóż\u0026hellip; nic nowego nie wymyśliłem ale realizacja pomysłu wydawała mi się ciekawą wprawka do kilku nowych technologii, którym miałem zamiar się przyglądnąć.\nRealizacja O ile RainbowDB działa na bazie: PHP + PostgreSQL + moduł w C do Postgresa, to w Hybrid Rainbow DB postanowiłem wykorzystać zupełnie nowe narzędzia i frameworki. Baza to MySQL, aplikację pisałem w Pythonie na Django.\nRealizacja zaczynała się od wygenerowania kilku słowników \u0026ldquo;składowych\u0026rdquo; dla złych haseł np.: liczby (od 0 do 100, powtarzające się cyfry do 10 znaków), daty (od 1950 do 2015, we wszystkich kombinacjach np.: YYMMDD, itd.), znaki (pojedyncze, jak również w przeróżnych kombinacjach z klawiatury, alfabetycznie, itd.). Mając takie słowniki zamierzałem wygenerować zbiory hashy ze sklejonych z nich słów na zasadzie: każde słowo z jednego słownika z każdym z drugiego. Jeśli pojedynczy słownik potraktujemy jako zbiór to taka operacja na dwóch lub więcej zbiorach nazywana jest iloczynem kartezjańskim. Wykonanie tego typu operacji jest stosunkowo proste ale nie zamierzałem zapisywać wyniku hashowania każdego tak wygenerowanego hasła. Idealnie byłoby móc zapisać wyniki w sposób podobny jak w tęczowych tablicach, czyli w jednym polu zakodować wynik kilku czy nawet kilkuset hashowań. Do tego musiałem opracować algorytm pozwalający przypisać danemu hasłu z iloczynu kartezjańskiego unikatowy jednoznacznie reprezentujący go numer. Odnosząc to do implementacji tęczowej tablicy, chodziło o funkcje redukującą, która zamieniała hash na numer a następnie generowała n-ty wynik iloczynu kartezjańskiego bez generowania wcześniejszych elementów. To podejście pozwoliło mi przechowywać nawet bardzo długie hasła w postaci kilku bajtów (jako numer) a przez to bardzo efektywnie wykorzystać miejsce.\nBy dodatkowo poprawić jakość generowanej \u0026ldquo;hybrydowej tęczowej tablicy\u0026rdquo; w czasie generowania wykorzystałem wektor bitowy by \u0026ldquo;odznaczyć\u0026rdquo; już wygenerowane hasła. Więc gdy dochodziło do ponownego zredukowania hasha na hasło, które już zostało wcześniej wykorzystane i byłby to powodem wystąpienia kolizji to zapisywany zostawał poprzedzający go hash, a proces generowania łańcucha był przerywany. Ten mechanizm znacznie zmniejszył częstotliwość występowania kolizji (więc późniejsze wykorzystanie tablic będzie szybsze), a jako efekt uboczny skrócił czas generowania tablic.\nZastosowałem jeszcze jedną sztuczkę by dodatkowo zmniejszyć rozmiar tablic. W większości tablic które utworzyłem nie było potrzeby przechowywać pełnych hashy aby móc odtworzyć hasło. W małych tablicach wystarczające były pierwsze 23 bajty, w większych 48. Zacząłem więc skracać długość przechowywanych hashy tak by utrzymać stosunkowo małą ilość kolizji. Dzięki tej optymalizacji mogłem na tej samej powierzchni dyskowej zapisać nawet 10-krotnie więcej danych.\nWnioski Pobawiłem się moimi nowymi tablicami i mam kilka spostrzeżeń. Ogólnie koncepcja się sprawdziła i hybrydy \u0026ldquo;trzaskają\u0026rdquo; nawet hashe, których moje wcześniejsze narzędzie nie ruszało (np. kilka hashy z pierwszej strony Top uncracked poprzedniego narzędzia).

Zadanie będzie o tyle ciekawe że dysk ma 4KB sektory i trzeb będzie dbać o wyrównanie zasobu do rozmiaru sektora, a w przypadku LVM\u0026rsquo;a wyrównanie do chunk\u0026rsquo;a z macierzy.\nPrawidłowe wyrównanie partycji Kupując nowy dysk (o pojemności od 500GB w górę), mamy spore szanse że trafimy na sztukę, która wykorzystuje 4KB sektory do alokacji danych. Ponieważ statystyczny rozmiar przechowywanych plików rośnie i nawet proste zdjęcie ma powyżej 1MB to wykorzystanie bloków o tym rozmiarze większym niż 512 bajtów jest jak najbardziej uzasadnione - zresztą większość systemów plików i tak wykorzystuje bloki 48KB. Jest tylko jedno ALE: jeżeli nie uwzględnimy tego podczas partycjonowania dysku to sektory 4KB systemu plików zamiast znajdować się w równo w odpowiadających im fizycznych 4KB sektorach dysku - mogą zachodzić na 2 sektory fizyczne - w takiej sytuacji każde odwołanie to takiego sektora w systemie plików wymaga odczytania/zapisanie dwóch sektorów fizycznych. Co prawda w dyskach stosuje się mechanizmy, które powinny zoptymalizować takie sytuacje ale jak potwierdzają benchmarki źle wyrównane partycja mogą znacznie obniżyć wydajność dysku. A jeszcze zabawniej jest jeśli kupimy dysk SSD bo w nich bardzo często fizyczne bloki są 128512KB i żeby było zabawniej to bardzo często dyski SSD deklarują (choćby przez SMART\u0026rsquo;a) że mają bloki 512B - SIC!\nJeśli mamy fart i nasz dysk raportuje rozmiar fizycznego sektora to możemy to sprawdzić tak:\ncat /sys/block/sda/queue/physical_block_size U mnie to polecenie zwróciło 4096 czyli 4KB co jest zgodne z deklaracją producenta.\nDobre podejście do tematu wyrównania partycji zaproponował Teo Tso czyli wybranie takich parametrów głowic/sektorów na ścieżce by fdisk automatycznie wyrównywał partycje do oczekiwanej przez nas wielkości bloku. Teo proponował użycie 224 głowic i 56 sektorów - co da wyrównanie do 128KB dla wszystkich partycji z wyjątkiem pierwszej (pierwsza będzie wyrównana do 4KB o ile nie wymusimy startu z 256 sektora). Jeżeli mamy dysk z blokami 4KB lub pierwszą partycję zamierzamy wykorzystać jako np. /boot (gdzie wydajność nie ma aż takiego dużego znaczenia) to jest to ok. Ale jeśli kompatybilność z DOS\u0026rsquo;em mamy w poważaniu to możemy w fdisku utworzyć pierwszą partycję wyrównaną do 128KB lub 1MB.\nPrzeważnie wolałem cfdiska od fdiska (bo po co się męczyć z topornym interfejsem) ale nie udało mi się skubańca zmusić by tworzył pierwszą partycję w sposób nie kompatybilny z DOS\u0026rsquo;em. fdisk pomimo toporności po podaniu liczby głowic i sektorów w ścieżce podpowiedział mi poprawne wyrównanie partycji (a gdybyśmy posiadali starszą wersję, która nie jest tak sprytna to przynajmniej możemy podać ręcznie od którego sektora ma zaczynać się partycja).\nWyrównanie do 128KB fdisk -u -H 224 -S 56 /dev/sdX Opcja -u zmienia domyślną jednostkę na sektory (mamy wtedy mniejsze liczby, które łatwiej się przelicza). Dla wyrównania do 128KB pierwsza partycja powinna się zaczynać na 256 sektorze. Do wyrównania do 4KB wystarczy zacząć na 56 sektorze (wystarczające przy części nowszych dysków twardych).\nWyrównanie do 1MB Jeśli jednak dysponujemy dyskiem SSD z ciężko powiedzieć jak dużym blokiem to lepiej wykorzystać wyrównanie do 1MB - zmarnujemy trochę więcej miejsca (tych parę MB jakoś przeżyjemy) ale w tym rozmiarze na pewno zmieści się każdy sektor (a może nawet Erase Block, który obecnie przeważnie ma 512KB choć zdarzają się sztuki z 4MB). Można to osiągnąć z ustawieniem 64 głowic i 32 sektorów na ścieżkę, robimy to tak:\nfdisk -u -H 64 -S 32 /dev/sdX Pierwsza partycja powinna się zaczynać na 2048 sektorze dla wyrównania do 1MB lub 8192 sektorze jeśli chcemy zacząć od 4MB.\nPo odpaleniu fdiska z tymi parametrami wybieramy opcję n i lecimy dalej zgodnie z podpowiedziami, np.:\nfdisk -u -H 224 -S 56 /dev/sdc Polecenie (m wyświetla pomoc): \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;m\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Polecenie a zmiana flagi rozruchu b modyfikacja etykiety dysku BSD c zmiana flagi kompatybilności z DOS-em d usunięcie partycji l wypisanie znanych typów partycji m wyświetlenie tego menu \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;n dodanie nowej partycji\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; o utworzenie nowej, pustej DOS-owej tablicy partycji p wypisanie tablicy partycji q zakończenie bez zapisywania zmian s utworzenie nowej, pustej etykiety dysku Suna t zmiana ID systemu partycji u zmiana jednostek wyświetlania/wprowadzania v weryfikacja tablicy partycji w zapis tablicy partycji na dysk i zakończenie x dodatkowe funkcje (tylko dla ekspertów) Polecenie (m wyświetla pomoc): \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;n\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Partition type: p primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free) e extended Select (default \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;p\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;): Using default response p Numer partycji (1-4, domyślnie \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;1\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;): Przyjęto wartość domyślną 1 Pierwszy sektor (2048-15240575, domyślnie \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;2048\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;): Przyjęto wartość domyślną 2048 Ostatni sektor, +sektorów lub +rozmiar{K,M,G} (2048-15240575, domyślnie 15240575): \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;+100M\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Polecenie (m wyświetla pomoc): \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;p\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Dysk /dev/sdc: 7803 MB, bajtów: 7803174912 głowic: 224, sektorów/ścieżkę: 56, cylindrów: 1214, w sumie sektorów: 15240576 Jednostka = sektorów, czyli 1 * 512 = 512 bajtów Rozmiar sektora (logiczny/fizyczny) w bajtach: 512 / 512 Rozmiar we/wy (minimalny/optymalny) w bajtach: 512 / 512 Identyfikator dysku: 0xc3072e18 Urządzenie Rozruch Początek Koniec Bloków ID System /dev/sdc1 2048 206847 102400 83 Linux Polecenie (m wyświetla pomoc): \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;w\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Tablica partycji została zmodyfikowana!

Po co w ogóle partycjonować - można użyć całych urządzeń Co prawda w przypadku gdy zamierzam całe dyski poświęcić na RAID\u0026rsquo;a mógłbym ich nie partycjonować tylko użyć całych urządzeń i zadbać tylko by mdadm poprawnie się wyrównał (co zresztą robi automatycznie do 4KB), ale obawiałem się jak względem takich dysków zachowają się inne systemy które mam zainstalowane na komputerze - nie chciałbym aby przypadkiem uznały że to jakiś uszkodzony dysk po czym zainicjowały tablicę partycji\u0026hellip; Może to nieuzasadniona fobia ale wiem że względem partycji RAID Autodetect nic takiego mi się nie przytrafi \u0026#x1f603;\nTworzenie macierzy RAID Jak już utworzymy pożądane partycje na pierwszym dysku to musimy je powielić na wszystkich pozostałych dyskach, które zamierzamy włączyć do macierzy - najprościej zrobić to sfdisk\u0026rsquo;iem:\nsfdisk -d /dev/sdX | sfdisk /dev/sdY Przy czym dysk sdX to źródłowy dysk z gotowymi partycjami, a dysk sdY to każdy na którym chcemy odtworzyć partycje. Można by zrobić na to ładną pętelkę jeśli mamy więcej tych dysków ale celowo tego nie zrobię bo jak znam życie to kiedyś ktoś to skopiuje ze znakiem nowego wiersza i wrzuci do konsoli\u0026hellip; 😀\nTeraz tworzę zdegradowaną (z dwóch dysków) macierz RAID5\u0026hellip; Ale na dobrą sprawę bezpieczniej byłoby utworzyć macierz RAID1 z dwóch dysków (o ile miejsca byłoby wystarczająco na przeniesienie danych) a po przeniesieniu danych na macierz dodanie trzeciego dysku i powiększenie macierzy z reshapingiem do RAID5 - postanowiłem pominąć takie rozwiązanie bo nie bałem się utraty danych, miałem dokładną kopię na innej macierzy \u0026#x1f603;\nWięc tworzymy macierz:\nmdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=5 --raid-devices=2 --chunk=512k /dev/sdX1 /dev/sdY1 Na dobrą sprawę z powyższych opcji tylko chunk nadaje się do \u0026ldquo;dopasowania\u0026rdquo; - ja mam zamiar utworzyć macierz z dość dużych zasobów (3x2TB) i przechowywać na niej raczej duże pliki więc 512KB wydaje mi się dobrą wartością. Gdybyśmy jednak potrzebowali większej liczby I/O dla małych pliczków to mniejsza wartość może być lepsza. Warto zrobić kilka benchmarków dla różnych wartości chunk\u0026rsquo;a i dopasować do przewidywanego przez nas obciążenia.\nAby macierz była widoczne już w czasie startu systemu należy dodatkowo wykonać polecenie:\nmdadm --detail --scan \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf Warto też w pliku /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf odkomentować i wpisać jakieś sensowne wartości dla HOMEHOST, MAILADDR.\nI teraz możemy odbudować obraz initrd:\nupdate-initramfs -u Optymalizacja macierzy RAID5 Sam proces tworzenia macierzy może zająć kilka/kilkanaście godzin - dlatego warto mu pomóc kilkoma zmianami.\nspeed_limit_xxx Na pierwszy rzut - domyślne wartości dla minimalnej i maksymalnej prędkości budowania/regenerowania/odtwarzania macierzy RAID5, można je sprawdzić:\ncat /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_max 200000 cat /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_min 1000 Domyślnie jest to minimum 1MB/s i maksimum 200MB/s. Podbijając minimalną prędkość do 10~50MB/s można kosztem większego obciążenia systemu zmusić macierz by odbudowywała się szybciej. Osobiście uważam tą optymalizację za mało znaczącą bo cały mechanizm dość elastycznie reaguje na obciążenie systemu i jeśli nic nie robimy to prędkości odbudowy są dość wysokie. Ale można to zrobić tak:\necho 50000 \u0026gt; /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_min lub tak:\nsysctl -w dev.raid.speed_limit_min=50000 stripe_cache_size Ta optymalizacja pomogła mi dużo - ok. 30% wzrost wydajności macierzy (również w czasie odbudowy parzystości). Możemy sprawdzić wartość tego parametru, np. tak:\ncat /sys/block/md0/md/stripe_cache_size Domyślnie jest to wartość 128 - bida z nędzą, u mnie ustawienie na 32768 (maksymalna wartość tego parametru) dało największy wzrost wydajności - ale już 8192 znacznie poprawiło wydajność.\nfor i in 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768; do echo \u0026#34;Testowanie $i\u0026#34; echo $i \u0026gt; /sys/block/md0/md/stripe_cache_size sync echo 3 \u0026gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1M count=10000 done Wyłączenie NCQ dla wszystkich dysków w macierzy Wydało mi się to nieco kontrowersyjne bo NCQ powinno pomagać przy losowych odczytach/zapisach - ale zapuściłem test bonnie++ i okazało się że z włączonym NCQ czasy dostępu dla niektórych obciążeń rosną nawet dziesięciokrotnie! Warto więc sprawdzić tą opcję pod przewidywanym przez nas scenariuszem obciążenia.\nNCQ dla poszczególnych dysków można wyłączyć np. tak:\nfor d in sdb sdc sdd do echo 1 \u0026gt; /sys/block/$d/device/queue_depth done Wyłączenie cache dyskowych Wyłączenie wbudowanej w dyski pamięci cache akurat nie zwiększa wydajności ale w przypadku awarii zasilania (lub innej gwałtownej awarii systemu) zwiększa szanse macierzy na przeżycie takiego incydentu. Obecnie większość systemów plików korzysta z opóźnienia zapisu by bardziej optymalnie zapisać dane na dysku - dlatego gdy zapisujemy dany to najpierw trafiają one do cache systemowego. Dopiero po sync\u0026rsquo;u są przesyłane do cache dyskowego skąd dopiero po pewnym czasie trafiają na dysk. Wyłączenie pamięci cache na dyskach \u0026ldquo;usuwa\u0026rdquo; nam to drugie opóźnienie.\nhdparm -W0 /dev/sd* Zmiana parametrów odczytu z wyprzedzeniem Bardzo ważnym parametrem mającym wpływ na wydajność macierzy jest odpowiednie ustawienie odczytu z wyprzedzeniem. Obecnie ustawioną wartość możemy sprawdzić tak (wartość wyrażona jest w 512 bajtowych sektorach):\nblockdev --getra /dev/md0 U mnie domyślnie było 4096 (a na innym starszym systemie tylko 1536) to może być zbyt mało dla konfiguracji RAID. Większe wartości można ustawić np. tak:\nblockdev --setra 65536 /dev/md0 A tak można wykonać sprawdzanie, która wartość będzie dla nas najbardziej optymalna:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1M count=10000 for i in 1536 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288; do echo \u0026#34;Testowanie $i\u0026#34; blockdev --setra $i /dev/md0 sync echo 3 \u0026gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches dd if=file of=/dev/null bs=1M done Tworzenie zasobu LVM Mając już macierze tworzę na niej volumen LVM - najpierw przygotowanie zasobu:\npvcreate /dev/md0 Jeżeli w /etc/lvm/lvm.conf mamy ustawione opcje:\nmd_component_detection = 1 md_chunk_alignment = 1 data_alignment_detection = 1 To LVM powinien automatycznie wykryć rozmiar chunk\u0026rsquo;a z RAID\u0026rsquo;a i dostosować swoje metadane, oraz początek danych tak by wszystko było prawidłowo wyrównane względem macierzy.\nJeśli nie mamy szczęścia (bardzo stare jajko/LVM) to będziemy musieli użyć opcji -metadatasize i/lub -dataalignment:\npvcreate --metadatasize 500k /dev/md0 Teraz ciekawostka - LVM potrzebuje na 192KB na dane nagłówkowe każdego wolumenu i każdy utworzony później zasób byłby o te 192KB przesunięty, więc \u0026hellip; trafia nasze wyrównanie do 128KB. Dlatego zmuszamy LVM\u0026rsquo;a by zaalokował nieco więcej - tutaj 256KB. OK - ale w poleceniu jest 250 - WTF? I to aby było zabawnie jest to jak najbardziej prawidłowa wartość - nie wiem jaka w tym logika, ale by metadane zajmowały 256KB podajemy 250k, by zajmowały 512KB podajemy 500k itd\u0026hellip;\nInaczej jest z opcją -dataalignment, tutaj najbardziej optymalnie należy podać rozmiar chunk\u0026rsquo;a*ilość aktywnych dysków (dla RAID5 odejmujemy jeden) - albo minimalnie rozmiar chunka, np.:\npvcreate --dataalignment 512K /dev/md0 Poprawność możemy sprawdzić poleceniem:\npvs /dev/md0 -o+pe_start PV VG Fmt Attr PSize PFree 1st PE /dev/md0 vgraid lvm2 a- 1,82t 488,89g 512,00k U mnie 1st PE zaczyna się na 512KB, więc jest OK.\nTeraz tworzymy grupę:\nvgcreate vgraid /dev/md0 Polecenie vgcreate posiada parametr -s który pozwala określić do wielokrotności jakiej wartości będzie zaokrąglana wielkość wolumenu - wartość ta powinna być wielokrotnością chunk\u0026rsquo;a z macierzy. Domyślnie ma ona wartość 4MB więc wszystko będzie ładnie wyrównane.\nI możemy zacząć tworzyć volumeny logiczne:\nlvcreate -L1T -nsrv vgraid Formatowanie To teraz formatowanie - tutaj też czasem trzeba się wysilić by utworzony przez nas filesystem działał możliwie optymalnie na macierzy i bloku o odpowiednim rozmiarze. W przypadku filesystemu na macierzy są dwa ważne parametry: stride i stripe-width. Stride powinien odpowiadać rozmiarowi podanemu jako chunk podczas tworzenia macierzy ale wyrażonego w blokach systemu plików (domyślnie 4KB). Stripe-width powinno być ustawione na: stride * N, gdzie N to ilość aktywnych dysków w macierzy (dla RAID5 jest to ilość dysków minus 1) - przykładowo dla bloku 4KB i chunk\u0026rsquo;a 512KB, stride powinien wynosić 128 (512/4). Z kolei stripe-width dla 3 dysków to 128*(3-1)=256. Prawidłowe dobranie tych parametrów może dać wzrost wydajności rzędu 40% (według moich testów). Teoretycznie na nowszych systemach tworzone systemy plików automatycznie powinny wykryć najbardziej optymalne wyrównanie - możemy więc spróbować puścić format bez tych parametrów i później skontrolować ich wartości poleceniem:\ntune2fs -l /dev/vgraid/srv Na początek przykład dla systemu plików dla małych i średnich plików:\nmkfs.ext4 -E stride=128,stripe-width=256,resize=4T -m0 /dev/vgraid/srv Jeden dodatkowy parametr to resize - pozwala on zmienić domyślne ustawienie maksymalnego rozmiaru do którego możemy powiększyć dany filesystem - domyślnie jest to wartość 1000 razy większa od początkowej wielkości - ciut przekozaczone. Może nie oszczędzi to dużo miejsca na dysku (kilkadziesiąt/kilkaset MB) ale na pewno skróci czas fsck\u0026rsquo;a.\nKolejny dodatek to -m0 które wyłącza alokację 5% przestrzeni dyskowej dla root\u0026rsquo;a i usług systemowych - po prostu tutaj tego nie potrzebuję a 5% z 1TB to 50GB marnującego się miejsca!\nJeśli wiemy że będziemy przechowywać na danym zasobie tylko stosunkowo duże pliki to można użyć takich opcji:\nmkfs.ext4 -E stride=128,stripe-width=256,resize=4T -T largefile -m0 /dev/vgraid/srv Opcja -T to wykorzystanie szablonów opcji dla tworzenia systemów plików, które można edytować i dodawać w pliku: /etc/mke2fs.conf. Szablon largefile wykorzystuje mniejszą liczbę inodów dla nowego filesystemu, jeśli zamierzamy przechowywać głównie duże pliki to zmniejszy to czas formatowania i późniejszych fsck\u0026rsquo;ów na tym systemie plików.\nTestowanie wydajności Zalecałbym testowanie wydajności na kolejnych etapach przygotowania dysków i powtarzać te same benchmarki po każdej zmianie, tak więc testujemy:\nNa początek wszystkie dyski, z których zamierzamy zbudować RAID\u0026rsquo;a by wykluczyć ewentualne \u0026ldquo;padaki\u0026rdquo;/uszkodzone kable, itp. Np. hdparm/dd na czystym dysku i dodatkowo iozone/bonnie++ na filesystemie by sprawdzić czy nie skopaliśmy wyrównania partycji. Po zbudowaniu RAID\u0026rsquo;a powtarzamy testy - na całym urządzeniu (dd) i po sformatowaniu (iozone/bonnie++) by upewnić się że RAID jest prawidłowo wyrównany (przy czym przy RAID5 możemy się spodziewać wyników przy zapisie niższych niż przy odczycie - jest to OK). Jest to też dobry moment na sprawdzenie kilku optymalizacji dla macierzy: stripe_cache_size, wyłączenie NCQ, ustawienia odczytu z wyprzedzeniem, wyłączenie cache dysków - po każdej z tych zmian ponawiamy benchmarki by upewnić się że uzyskaliśmy poprawę/lub nie. Po przygotowaniu LVM\u0026rsquo;a - ponawiamy benchmarki na volumenie by upewnić się że nie skopaliśmy wyrównania partycji/chunk\u0026rsquo;a/itd\u0026hellip; Dopieszczamy opcje formatowania filesystemu i jego montowania (np. noatime, commit, data, itd) - i znów posiłkujemy się benchmarkami by potwierdzić że pniemy się z wydajnością w górę. Jeśli myślicie że to dużo to zalecałbym powtórzenie części benchmarków 23 krotnie by upewnić się że wyniki nie odbiegają znacznie od siebie. Dodatkowo powinniśmy czyścić przed każdym banchmarkiem cache dyskowy aby mieć pewność że lepsze wyniki nie są skutkiem wczytania danych do pamięci. Z tego samego powodu jeśli uruchamiamy benchmarki to ilość zapisywanych/odczytywanych danych powinna być minimum 1,52 razy większa niż pamieć RAM zainstalowana w systemie by na pewnie wszystkie dane nie zmieściły się w cache\u0026rsquo;u. Oczywiście można to zlać ale później nie ma się co dziwić że system działa wolno - a na produkcyjnej maszynie dużo trudniej zaorać całą konfiguracją i utworzyć od początku z prawidłowym wyrównaniem.\nZalecane jest wykorzystanie IOZone lub Bonnie++ ponieważ testują one nie tylko prosty sekwencyjny odczyt, ale również tworzenie/kasowanie plików o różnych rozmiarach i w różnej ilości - to pozwala lepiej sprawdzić opóźnienia występujące przy przewidywanych przez nas obciążeniach oraz upewnić się że cała zabawa z wyrównywaniem zasobów miała sens. Oczywiście to tylko zalecenia 😉\nhdparm W przypadku macierzy wykorzystanie prostego hdparm\u0026rsquo;a do testów:\nhdparm -tT /dev/md0 nie zwróci realnych i sensownych wyników. Pomiar jest zbyt krótki by uzyskać sensowne wyniki - lepiej wykorzystać dd z dużą ilością danych do odczytu.\ndd Narzędzie jakże prymitywne a tak przydatne. Możemy nim zmierzyć sekwencyjny odczyt/zapis z/do macierzy i uzyskać bardziej realne wyniki niż hdparm\u0026rsquo;em. Wystarczy wymusić operację na ok. dwukrotnie większej ilości danych niż ilość pamięci RAM. Dodatkowo czyścimy cache\u0026rsquo;e przed i po mierząc całościowy czas, np. tak:\nsync; echo 3 \u0026gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; time (dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test/test.img bs=1024K count=10240 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sync) Jest to szczególnie przydatne np. przy dopasowywaniu optymalnej dla nas wartości parametru stripe_cache_size, wystarczy przygotować odpowiednią pętlę:\nfor i in 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768; do echo \u0026#34;stripe_cache_size $i\u0026#34; echo $i \u0026gt; /sys/block/md0/md/stripe_cache_size sync; echo 3 \u0026gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; time (dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test/test.img bs=1024K count=10240 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sync) done Parametr bs określa bufor wykorzystywany przy operacjach odczytu/zapisu - można go dostosować do rozmiaru chunk\u0026rsquo;a/stripe-width/itp.. count określa jak dużo takich buforów odczytać/zapisać - w powyższym przypadku jest to 10 tys. jednomegabajtowych buforów więc łącznie 10GB.\nbonnie++ Bonnie++ wymaga nieco przygotowania ale wyniki w moim przypadku bardzo odpowiadały rzeczywistym. Co pokrótce trzeba zrobić:\nmkdir /srv/test chown -R guest:guest /srv/test bonnie++ -d /srv/test -s 16g -m nazwa_maszyny -f -u guest Możemy dodać opcję -b by po każdej operacji wykonywany był sync - to byłoby coś podobnego do systemów bazodanowych lub pocztowych. Jeżeli chcemy zasymulować standardowe operacje na plikach to nie potrzebujemy tej opcji.\niozone W najprostszym wykonaniu:\niozone -a Wykona to serię pomiarów na różnych rozmiarach plików, ilości powtórzeń itd. Najbardziej interesująca opcją w konfiguracji RAID jest \u0026ldquo;Stride read\u0026rdquo;.\niozone -S 8192 -t 1 Parametr -S przekazuje rozmiar pamięci cache procesora - wykorzystywany do alokacji pamięci blokami itp (sprawdzałem czy to cokolwiek pomoże.. ale nie widziałem dużej różnicy).\nParametr -t 1 to benchmark przepustowości dysku a parametr cyfrowy określa liczbę równoczesnych wątków, które będą odczytywać/zapisywać - można w ten sposób zasymulować np. równoczesny streaming dla wielu źródeł, itp.\niozone -S 8192 -a -s 40960 Tutaj parametr -s wskazuje na jakim rozmiarze pliku w KB ma być prowadzony benchmark - tutaj 40MB.\nPodsumowanie Ogólnie zadowolony jestem że udało mi się to wszystko zebrać w jednym poście bo dotychczas miałem to zapisane w wielu różnych zakładkach i spory problem gdy potrzebowałem \u0026ldquo;właśnie tego jednego polecenia\u0026rdquo;. Ale niezadowolony jestem z tego że nie udało mi się ustalić całości tego postępowania dla dysków o sektorach/erase block\u0026rsquo;ach większych niż 4 KB. Chodzi mi szczególnie o brak jasnego wyjaśnienia czy RAID5 jest prawidłowo wyrównywany bo według jednych tak właśnie jest, a według innych tak nie jest. Stąd niektórzy zalecają by stosować format metadanych dla macierzy w wersji 0.9 lub 1.0 zamiast 1.2 ale nie ma jasnych źródeł tego rozumowania.

Co prawda w dyskach stosuje się mechanizmy, które powinny zoptymalizować takie sytuacje ale jak potwierdzają benchmarki źle wyrównane partycja mogą znacznie obniżyć wydajność dysku.

Nie brzmi to jakoś strasznie ale problem okazał się być całkiem nietrywialnym. Teoretyczne rozwiązanie sprowadzało się do wyszukania loginu użytkownika ze ścieżki URI i porównania z nazwą użytkownika ze zmiennej %{REMOTE_USER} - jeśli wartości się różnią to Forbidden. Ale szybko okazało się że w RewriteCond zmienne z dopasowań można podstawiać tylko w pierwszym parametrze i że o ile można RewriteCond\u0026rsquo;y połączyć wyrażeniami logicznymi typu AND/OR to nie ma możliwości porównania czy dopasowania z kolejnych RewriteCond\u0026rsquo;ów są identyczne. Po kilku dniach szperania w dokumentacji i różnych tutorialach udało mi się trafić na jedną wartościową wskazówkę ale tej stronki już nie ma, więc opiszę problem dla potomnych.\nZałożenia są takie:\nmamy vhost\u0026rsquo;a który udostępnia wszystkie foldery użytkowników, każdy użytkownik posiada folder o nazwie dokładnie takiej samej jak jego login, użytkownik po zalogowaniu ma być przekierowany do swojego folderu i przy próbie przejścia do folderów innych użytkowników albo nawracamy go do jego folderu/albo dajemy forbidden. Konfiguracja vhost\u0026rsquo;a Poniżej podstawowa konfiguracja vhost\u0026rsquo;a:\n\u0026lt;VirtualHost *:80\u0026gt; ServerName files.example.com ServerAlias www.files.example.com DocumentRoot /var/www/files ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log LogLevel warn CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined \u0026lt;Directory /var/www/files\u0026gt; AllowOverride none AuthType basic AuthName \u0026#34;Zaloguj sie\u0026#34; AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/passwd Require valid-user \u0026lt;/Directory\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/VirtualHost\u0026gt; Rewrite\u0026rsquo;y I najciekawsza część czyli rewrite\u0026rsquo;y. Zaczynamy od przekierowania użytkownika do jego folderu:\nRewriteRule ^$ /%{REMOTE_USER} [R,L] Powyższy rewrite sprawdza czy próbujemy wejść do głównego katalogu, jeśli tak to przekierowujemy do katalogu użytkownika.\nTo teraz magia, której długo szukałem \u0026#x1f603;\nRewriteCond %{REMOTE_USER} ^(.+) RewriteCond %1:$1 !^([^:]+):\\1$ RewriteRule ^([^/]+)/ - [F,L] Już wyjaśniam co to robi - zacznę od przypomnienia że pomimo takiego zapisu w konfiguracji reguły są przetwarzane nieco inaczej: Apache najpierw sprawdza czy dany URI pasuje do wyrażenia w RewriteRule, a dopiero gdy tak jest sprawdzane są warunki w RewriteCond. Czyli RewriteRule dopasowuje pierwszą część URI aż do znaku ukośnika / i zapamiętuje w zmiennej $1. Dopiero teraz RewriteCond dopasowuje i zapamiętuje login użytkownika w zmiennej %1 (tak rule zapamiętuje w zmiennych z $, cond w zmiennych z %). Teraz gdy mamy już zapamiętane loginy z URI i zmiennej to możemy je zapisać obok siebie w kolejnym RewriteCond oddzielając znakiem który w loginie wystąpić nie powinien (np. dwukropkiem) - $1:%1. Teraz dopasowujemy pierwszą część \u0026ldquo;sklejki\u0026rdquo;, czyli ^([^:]+): i zaraz potem wymagamy by pojawiła się ta sama wartość przez wsteczną referencję \\1$ - to porównywane jest z pierwszym parametrem cond\u0026rsquo;a. To dopasowanie jest prawdziwe gdy użytkownik loguje się prawidłowo, więc negujemy je stawiając ! na początku regexp\u0026rsquo;a, by każde błędne logowanie powodowało wywołanie RewriteRule, czyli Forbidden.\nPogmatwane? Więc teraz na przykładzie:\nbłędne logowanie (bo prostsze):\nlogin: roman\nuri: zbyszek/\npo dopasowaniu w $1 mamy zbyszek, a w %1 mamy roman, więc $1:%1 to zbyszek:roman, ostatni cond sprawdza czy zbyszek:roman różni się od zbyszek:zbyszek - a skoro tak to blokujemy dostęp, dobre logowanie:\nlogin: roman\nuri: roman/\npo dopasowaniu w $1 i %1 mamy roman i sprawdzamy czy $1:%1 jest zgodne z roman:roman, a jest więc po negacji nie blokujemy dostępu. Skoro dostępu nie blokujemy to roman może dostać się do swoich plików.

Ale szybko okazało się że w \u003cem\u003eRewriteCond\u003c/em\u003e zmienne z dopasowań można podstawiać tylko w pierwszym parametrze i że o ile można \u003cem\u003eRewriteCond\u0026rsquo;y\u003c/em\u003e połączyć wyrażeniami logicznymi typu \u003cem\u003eAND\u003c/em\u003e/\u003cem\u003eOR\u003c/em\u003e to nie ma możliwości porównania czy dopasowania z kolejnych \u003cem\u003eRewriteCond\u0026rsquo;ów\u003c/em\u003e są identyczne.

To nadrabiam.\nTworzenie i usuwanie maszyn wirtualnych Do tworzenia/niszczenia DomU wykorzystuję pakiet xen-tools dostarczający m.in. dwa narzędzia:\nxen-create - dla którego przygotowałem dość skomplikowaną konfigurację przy okazji wcześniejszego posta: Instalacja i konfiguracja DomU\u0026thinsp; external link . Przykład użycia: xen-create --hostname example-domu --ip 10.0.0.77 \\ --gateway 10.0.0.1 --broadcast 10.0.0.255 --netmask 255.255.255.0 \\ --bridge br10 --vcpus 2 --memory=2G xen-delete-image - narzędzie do kasowania wirtualnych maszyn. Maszyna musi być wyłączona aby można było ją usunąć. Narzędzie to kasuje plik konfiguracyjny maszyny wirtualnej oraz przydzielone jej volumeny lvm. Przykład użycia: xen-delete-image nazwamaszyny Zarządzanie maszynami wirtualnymi Do uruchamiania, wyłączanie, resetowania (i ogólnie zarządzania) maszynami wirtualnymi służy tylko jedno polecenie: xm z różnymi parametrami:\nxm list- listuje uruchomione w danej chwili wirtualne maszyny, wyświetlając przydzieloną im ilość pamięci, procesorów, stan (uruchomiona, zawieszona), czas działania (uptime). Dla objaśnienia Domain-0 (zwane też Dom-O) to hyperwisor czyli fizyczna maszyna na której uruchomione są wirtualki. xm top - polecenie wyświetla dokładne dane chwilowego zużycia zasobów dla różnych wirtualnych maszyn i Dom-0. xm create nazwapliku.cfg - uruchamia maszynę wirtualną zgodnie z instrukcjami zawartymi w pliku konfiguracyjnym (przydzielone dyski, pamięć, etc). xm shutdown nazwamaszyny - wysyła sygnał wyłączenia maszyny wirtualnej i wraca do wiersza poleceń. Dokładnie to polecenie wysyła sygnał ACPI równoważny przyciśnięciu przycisku Power na obudowie komputera - system operacyjny wykrywa to zdarzenie i zaczyna się wyłączać. Jest to zalecana instrukcja do wyłączania wirtualek. Należy pamiętać, że po wykonaniu tego polecenia jeszcze przez kilka/kilkanaście sekund maszyna działa - do puki nie skończy się wyłączać. xm shutdown -w nazwamaszyny - działa jak powyższe polecenie, ale dodatkowo czeka aż maszyna wirtualna zostanie wyłączona a przydzielone jej zasoby zwolnione. Gdy to polecenie skończy się wykonywać mamy pewność, że maszyna jest już wyłączona. xm destroy nazwamaszyny - polecenie do twardego resetu maszyny wirtualnej. Najpierw odbierany jest czas procesora dla maszyny, potem zwalniana pamięć i zarezerwowane uchwyty. Wykorzystując to polecenie może dojść do utraty danych lub uszkodzenia OS‘u na wirtualnej maszynie. xm reboot nazwamaszyny - restartuje maszynę wirtualną w bezpieczny sposób (czyli wysyła sygnał ACPI do wyłączenia i startuje DomU). Gdy zmodyfikujemy plik konfiguracyjny danego DomU nie wystarczy wywołać xm reboot - przeważnie potrzeba położyć maszynę i ponownie ją uruchomić, np. tak: xm shutdown -w maszyna \u0026amp;\u0026amp; xm create maszyna.cfg xm pause nazwamaszyny - pauzuje wirtualną maszynę, zamrażając ją w obecnym stanie razem z pamięcią itd. xm unpause nazwamaszyny - uruchamia zapauzowaną wcześniej maszynę wirtualną. Działa odwrotnie do polecenia powyżej. xm console nazwamaszyny - polecenie działa jak „podpięcie monitora” do fizycznej maszyny, na pierwszy terminal. Bardzo przydatne zaraz po utworzeniu wirtualki jak również w różnych sytuacjach kryzysowych 😉 Jest jeszcze kilka innych poleceń np. dodających na gorąco urządzenia blokowe ale ich działanie mocno zależy od wersji Xen\u0026rsquo;a i jajka.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2012/06/xen-podstawowe-polecenia/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePisałem już \u003ca href=\"/2012/02/xen-na-squeeze-instalacja-i-konfiguracja-hypervisora/\" \u003eHOWTO o konfiguracji Xen\u0026rsquo;a\u003c/a\u003e\n ale nie opisałem jak się bawić wirtualkami gdy Xen\u0026rsquo;a już mamy.

Gdy druga aplikacja potrzebuje dostępu do tych plików wystarczy podać ścieżkę. Problemy zaczynają się gdy aplikacji jest kilka i rozmieszczonych na kilku serwerach. Można korzystać z sieciowych systemów plików ale to często nie jest zbyt wygodne - ciężko odpowiednio ustawić uprawnienia by pewne aplikacje miały dostęp do zapisu plików a inne nie, trzeba skonfigurować dany katalog w kilku miejscach w konfiguracji serwera WWW aby serwować pliki itp\u0026hellip;\nJeżeli w utrzymaniu swoich aplikacji dociera się do takiego momentu to kolejne pomysły zakładają wykorzystanie bazy danych do przechowywania plików. Ale chwila googlania i już wiemy że bazy typu SQL średnio radzą sobie z przetwarzaniem tak dużych rekordów jak pliki. Kolejny etap to sprawdzenie co mogą nam zaoferować bazy NoSQL.\nW tym miejscu przeczytałem wiele różnych artykułów i ostatecznie zastanawiałem się czy wybrać MongoDB czy CouchDB. Oba projekty są bardzo podobne a główną ich zaletą jest łatwość wykorzystania w istniejących aplikacjach webowych. Tutaj szczególnie CouchDB wypada bardzo dobrze bo zarządzanie i dostęp do bazy odbywa się standardowym protokołem HTTP - polecenia wydaje się POST\u0026rsquo;ami, a dane pobiera GET\u0026rsquo;ami. Dzięki takiej budowie łatwo można schować CouchDB za reverse proxy i serwować np. pliki uploadowane przez użytkowników wprost z bazy - bez dorabiania dodatkowych interfejsów. Bardzo łatwo też obsługuje się bazę z poziomu aplikacji AJAX. Więc w moim przypadku wypadło na CouchDB.\nInstalacja Instalacja na Debianie jest banalna i sprowadza się do:\napt-get install -y couchdb TADAM! Mamy działające CouchDB. Domyślnie baza nasłuchuje na adresie 127.0.0.1 i porcie 5984.\nDodatkowo Couch posiada webowy interfejs (zwany Futon\u0026rsquo;em) zarządzający dostępny na tym samym porcie pod adresem, np. http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/\nOptymalizacja NODELAY W moim przypadku CouchDB służy do przechowywania zarówno bardzo wielu małych plików, jak i kilku całkiem sporych. W przypadku bardzo małych plików CouchDB w wersji 0.11 czeka z wysłaniem odpowiedzi od razu bo być może uda się \u0026ldquo;dorzucić coś jeszcze\u0026rdquo;. Takie zachowanie może powodować opóźnienia przy pobieraniu małych plików, warto więc zmienić w pliku /etc/couchdb/local.ini taką opcję:\n[httpd] socket_options = [{nodelay, true}] Ustawienie opcji TCP NODELAY wyłączy opóźnienie przy wysyłaniu małych plików.\nIdentyfikatory Warto zastanowić się nad długością i schematem identyfikatorów dla rekordów. Domyślnie mają one 32 bajty co przy małej liczbie elementów w bazie jest mocną przesadą. Rozmiar identyfikatorów znacznie wpływa na rozmiar bazy i jej wydajność - dlatego czasem warto opracować własny schemat generowanych identyfikatorów. Przykładowo jeśli identyfikator będzie generowany z cyfr oraz dużych i małych liter to dla 3 znaków możemy wygenerować identyfikatory dla ponad 260 tys. elementów, dla 4 znaków już ponad 14 milionów co powinno wystarczyć dla średniej wielkości bazy.\nUstawienia bezpieczeństwa Trochę mnie zaskoczyło podejście do bezpieczeństwa w bazie CouchDB - domyślnie po instalacji baza działa w trybie Admin Party, czyli każda osoba która wejdzie do zarządzania bez logowania ma uprawnienia administratora \u0026#x1f604;\nMnie ten stan rzeczy nie bardzo odpowiadał więc:\nodpalamy interfejs zarządzający - Futon i w prawym dolnym rogu szukamy tekstu: \u0026ldquo;Welcome to Admin Party! Everyone is admin. Fix this\u0026rdquo; - klikamy na \u0026ldquo;Fix this\u0026rdquo;, w okienku które się pojawi podajemy login i hasło administratora.\nPo ustawieniu konta administratora dalsze musimy zadbać o ustawienie odpowiednich uprawnień dla każdej nowo tworzonej bazy, czyli bazy tworzą się dostępem dla wszystkich ale możemy ograniczyć np. zapis/odczyt dla pewnych grup użytkowników.\nZabezpieczenie bazy użytkowników Po ustawieniu pierwszego użytkownika kolejna rzecz, o którą powinniśmy zadbać do dostępna dla każdego do odczytu baza użytkowników. Najlepiej gdy tylko administratorzy będą mieli do niej dostęp. By to osiągnąć:\nw Futonie wchodzimy do bazy _users i klikamy przycisk \u0026ldquo;Security\u0026rdquo; na górze strony, w okienku które się pojawi w polu Readers -\u0026gt; Roles (pole na samym dole) wpisujemy [\u0026quot;admin\u0026quot;] Od teraz tylko administratorzy mają dostęp do bazy _users.\nUstawienie bazy jako tylko do odczytu To co chciałem osiągnąć korzystając z CouchDB to jakieś repozytorium, do którego wrzucać mogą wybrańcy a czytać wszyscy (np. taki CDN dla stronki itp) ale otrzymanie takiego rezultatu jest nieco\u0026hellip; nieintuicyjne. By to osiągnąć:\nw bazie którą chcemy ustawić jako tylko do odczytu wchodzimy w Security i w polu Admin Roles (drugie z góry) wpisujemy [\u0026quot;admin\u0026quot;] - to zablokuje dostęp do panelu Security i możliwości modyfikowania design dokumentów, nadal możliwe jest jednak dodawanie, modyfikowani i kasowanie dokumentów,\nby zablokować dostęp do zapisu w CouchDB trzeba wykorzystać funkcję validate_doc_update która będzie wywoływana przy każdej próbie dostępu do pojedynczego dokumentu, by z niej skorzystać tworzymy nowy pusty dokument, zmieniamy pole _id dokumentu na _design/auth dodajemy pole nazwane language z wartością javascript dodajemy kolejne pole nazwane validate_doc_update z wartością: function(newDoc, oldDoc, userCtx) { if (userCtx.roles.indexOf(\u0026#39;_admin\u0026#39;) !== -1) { return; } else { throw({forbidden: \u0026#39;Nie jesteś administratorem!\u0026#39;}); } } zapisujemy dokument klikając na \u0026ldquo;Save Document\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2012/06/couchdb-instalacja-i-wstepna-konfiguracja/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGdy tworzymy pierwszą aplikację webową, która umożliwia upload plików przeważnie lądują one lokalnie w pewniej lokalizacji.

Lecimy po kolei:\n# Virtual machine disks are created as logical volumes in # volume group \u0026#39;universe\u0026#39; (hint: LVM storage is much faster # than file) lvm = universe Osobiście korzystam z LVM\u0026rsquo;a który zgodnie z hint\u0026rsquo;em jest znacznie szybszy od plików obrazów. Daje do tego bardzo wygodne możliwość w zarządzaniu rozmiarami wolumenów przydzielonych DomU, możliwość tworzenia snapshotów (np. na potrzeby backupu). Postawienie LVM\u0026rsquo;a w skrócie wygląda tak:\napt-get install lvm2 pvcreate /dev/sdb1 # to tylko przyklad - samodzielnie ustal partycje :) vgcreate universe /dev/sdb1 vgchange -a y universe Pozostałe opcje i bardziej skomplikowane przypadki tworzenia LVM\u0026rsquo;a można znaleźć tutaj: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/commontask.html\nUstalamy domyślne parametry dla tworzonych DomU - oczywiście zawsze możemy je nadpisać poprzez podanie innej wartości w linii poleceń, np. -memory 4Gb:\nsize = 8Gb # Disk image size. memory = 512Mb # Memory size swap = 1Gb # Swap size xfs_options = noatime,nodiratime Domyślnie nie ma konfiguracji dla systemu plików ext4, wystarczy dodać w odpowiednich miejscach:\nfs = ext4 ext4_options = noatime,nodiratime,errors=remount-ro Ustawienia sieci:\n# Default gateway and netmask for new VMs gateway = 10.0.10.1 netmask = 255.255.255.0 broadcast = 192.168.3.255 Warto ustawić domyślne ustawienia sieci - choć ja osobiście wolę zawsze podawać te parametry ręcznie.\n# When creating an image, interactively setup root password passwd = 1 Dzięki tej opcji na koniec tworzenia DomU zostaniemy poproszeni o podanie hasła dla root\u0026rsquo;a.\n# This is most useful on 64 bit host machines, for other systems it # doesn\u0026#39;t need to be used. # arch = amd64 Domyślna architektura dla tworzonych DomU - można przedefiniować z linii poleceń.\n# Uncomment if you wish newly created images to boot once they\u0026#39;ve been # created. # boot = 0 Ja nie lubię gdy DomU uruchamiają się automatycznie po przygotowaniu bo często ręcznie modyfikuję konfigurację i dopiero uruchamiam wirtualkę - stąd 0.\n# Let xen-create-image use pygrub, so that the grub from the VM is used, # which means you no longer need to store kernels outside the VMs. # Keeps things very flexible. pygrub=1 role = pygrub, myconfig Ta opcja powoduje że DomU będzie posiadać własny kernel, który może być aktualizowany niezależnie od kernela hypervisora. Włączenie tej opcji wymaga dodatkowej roli (pygrub) która zainstaluje wymagane pakiety, etc. Niestety roli tej nie ma w standardowej instalacji więc zamieszczam poniżej plik znaleziony w sieci.

Do jabłek dodajemy żurawinę, skrapiamy całość sokiem z cytryny, po czym dodajemy cynamon, kardamon i miód.\nPo wyjęciu z lodówki wypełniamy wnętrze kaczki wcześniej przygotowanym farszem i zaszywamy. Do rozgrzanego piekarnika (170-190 stopni) wstawiamy kaczkę umieszczoną w naczyniu pod przykryciem. Po około 1,5 godziny wyjmujemy kaczkę z piekarnika i z obu stron nacinamy skórę pomiędzy udami a korpusem - umożliwi to wypłynięcie zebranego pod skórą tłuszczu. Co 30 minut należy kaczkę podlewać powstałym sosem.\nCzas pieczenia kaczki zależy od jej wagi. Ważąca 1,5-2 kg sztukę należy piec od 90 minut do 2 godzin. Na godzinę przed końcem pieczenia wlewamy czerwone wino (ok. pół butelki). Na ostatnie 20 minut zdejmujemy pokrywę i przełączamy piekarnik na zapiekanie od góry by skórka mogła się zrumienić.\nWynik Całkiem puściło moje kiepskie szycie ale smaku to nie popsuło :)\nŹródło: Ugotowani\u0026thinsp; external link ","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2012/02/kaczka-pieczona-z-zurawina-i-jablkami/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBardzo udany przepis - gdzieś musiałem go udokumentować by nie zginął :)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"składniki\"\u003eSkładniki\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 duża kaczka (2-2,5 kg)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4 ząbki czosnku\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e1 kg jabłek (w zależności od kaczki mogą wystarczyć 3 większe sztuki)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esok z cytryny do skropienia jabłek\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e200 g suszonej żurawiny\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epół butelki czerwonego wytrawnego wina\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003erozmaryn\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e4 łyżki miodu\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ecynamon\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ekardamon\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003esól\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epieprz\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"sposób-wykonania\"\u003eSposób wykonania\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaczkę nacieramy solą, pieprzem, rozmarynem oraz roztartym czosnkiem i\npozostawiamy na min. 3-4 godziny w lodówce (można też przygotować ją\nwieczorem by była gotowa na następny dzień).\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Kaczka pieczona z żurawiną i jabłkami"},{"content":"Po co mi to? Wiele razy miałem do czynienia z serwerami na których działało kilka/kilkanaście usług równocześnie, np. Apache (kilka stronek, webmail, phpmyadmin, itp), Postfix/Exim (poczta i żeby było fajnie to na kontach systemowych), Samba (jakieś zasoby dla pracowników), MySQL (baza dla stronek), PostgreSQL (bo jedna stronka potrzebowała), itd\u0026hellip;. Przy takiej konfiguracji pomijane są kwestie separacji usług zewnętrznych/wewnętrznych - no ale firma/instytucja mała nie ma sensu kasy na 3 kolejne serwery wydawać skoro działa\u0026hellip;.\nTaka konfiguracja nie jest zbyt bezpieczna i ma wiele wad:\nciężko backupować tak duży system w postaci obrazów, a odzyskiwanie z backupów całości będzie trwać wieki, słaba separacja usług ułatwia ataki na zasoby wewnętrzne (np. dziura w stronie może pozwolić na dostęp do plików z Samby), trudno rozgraniczyć zasoby sprzętowe (procesor, pamięć) konkretnym usługom, trudno jest migrować usługi na inne serwery. Wirtualizacja pozwala na zminimalizowanie tych problemów:\nbackupować można pojedyncze usługi (działające na różnych maszynach wirtualnych) np. z pomocą snapshotów z minimalnym czasem przerwy w działaniu, oddzielenie usług w osobnych maszynach wirtualnych pozwala \u0026ldquo;zamknąć\u0026rdquo; napastnika w przypadku kompromitacji którejś z usług (choć zdarzały się błędy w implementacji maszyn wirtualnych pozwalające \u0026ldquo;wyskoczyć\u0026rdquo; z wirtualki), możemy przydzielać pamięć i konkretne rdzenie procesora danym maszynom wirtualnym, live migration pozwala w locie przenieść maszynę wirtualną na inny serwer. Xen jest szczególnie dobrym wyborem jeżeli zamierzamy wirtualizować systemy Linux\u0026rsquo;owe. Można je uruchamiać w trybie para-wirtualizacji, która w mniejszym stopniu niż pełna wirtualizacja obciąża CPU.\nW trybie pełnej wirtualizacji można zainstalować praktycznie dowolny system (również Windows) choć jest to tryb mniej wydajny.\nUwaga Post ten jest próbą zebrania w jednym miejscu różnych moich doświadczeń z Xen\u0026rsquo;em ale nie miałem czasu na testową instalację według poniższego tekstu, więc mogłem gdzieś coś zamieszać. Dlatego proszę o komentowanie jeśli coś nie zadziała.\nKonfiguracja hypervisor\u0026rsquo;a (Dom0) Jeżeli zastanawiasz się czy stawiać Xen\u0026rsquo;a na 32 czy 64-bitowym systemie to wybierz 64-bit. Na systemie 64-bitowym można uruchamiać systemy gości 32 i 64-bitowe (w przeciwieństwie do hypervisora 32-bitowego) i nie będzie problemów z obsługą dużej ilości pamięci.\nZaczynamy od instalacji hypervisor\u0026rsquo;a, zmodyfikowanej do działania z Xen wersji jądra i pakietu podstawowych narzędzi. Wszystko co potrzebne jest w jednym metapakiecie (xen-linux-system ale gdyby nie chciał iść to lepiej wskazać konkretną wersję):\napt-get install xen-linux-system-2.6-xen-amd64 By mieć dostęp do pełnej wirtualizacji (np. by uruchamiać systemy Windows) należy doinstalować jeszcze jedną paczkę (jeśli nie potrzebujemy to zawsze można doinstalować później):\napt-get install xen-qemu-dm-4.0 Squeeze domyślnie korzysta z GRUB\u0026rsquo;a 2 i niezbyt przeze mnie lubianej metody wykrywania systemów, która po zainstalowaniu jajka dla Xen\u0026rsquo;a nadal będzie domyślnie startować podstawowy kernel. By to zmienić proponuję przenieść wykrywanie domyślnego systemu na pozycję późniejszą niż Xen\u0026rsquo;a - zmieniamy nazwę pliku:\nmv /etc/grub.d/10_linux /etc/grub.d/21_linux Ponadto jeżeli zamierzamy instalować DomU na LVM\u0026rsquo;ie to na pewno zainteresuje nas wyłączenie opcji OS prober by DomU nie były wykrywane jako zainstalowane lokalnie systemy (wyłączy to też wykrywanie Windowsa jeśli jest zainstalowany na tej samej maszynie).\nBy wyłączyć OS prober\u0026rsquo;a otwórz plik /etc/default/grub i dodaj na końcu:\n# Wylaczenie OS prober\u0026#39;a by nie wykrywac maszyn wirtualnych na # logicznych wolumenach LVM i nie pokazywac ich w menu grub\u0026#39;a GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true Jeżeli chcesz dodać jakieś dodatkowe parametry przy bootowaniu Xen\u0026rsquo;a dodaj poniższe zmienne w /etc/default/grub (przypisane wartości nie są prawidłowe i jeśli nic nie potrzebujesz dodawać to pomiń ten krok):\n# parametry dla wszystkich opcji startowych Xen\u0026#39;a (rowniez recovery) GRUB_CMDLINE_XEN=\u0026#34;something\u0026#34; # dodatkowe parametry dla opcji non-recovery GRUB_CMDLINE_XEN_DEFAULT=\u0026#34;something else\u0026#34; Po modyfikacji opcji gruba musimy wykonać aktualizację poleceniem:\nupdate-grub Domyślnym zachowaniem dom0 Xen\u0026rsquo;a przy wyłączaniu bądź restartowaniu jest próba zahibernowania wszystkich działających domU. Gdy nie przewidzimy takiej sytuacji i nie mamy wystarczającej ilości wolnego miejsca w /var często proces ten kończy się błędami. Zdarzają się też problemy z prawidłową obsługą hibernacji po stronie systemów działających w domU, wtedy po uruchomieniu dom0 i próbie załadowania zapisanych stanów maszyn kończymy z wiszącymi wirtualkami.\nNa dobrą sprawę równie dobrym zachowaniem byłoby wyłączenie wszystkich domU i zaczekanie aż to nastąpi a po starcie dom0 uruchomienie ich od zera. Może cały proces będzie trwać chwilę dłużej ale mamy za to większą pewność że przejdzie bez niespodzianek. By ustawić takie zachowanie Xen\u0026rsquo;a edytujemy /etc/default/xendomains:\nXENDOMAINS_RESTORE=false XENDOMAINS_SAVE= Aby systemy domU miały dostęp do sieci należy w pliku /etc/xen/xend-config.sxp upewnić się że network-script ustawione jest na network-bridge.\n(network-script \u0026#39;network-bridge antispoof=yes\u0026#39;) Przy takim ustawieniu systemu domU będą korzystać z głównego interfejsu dom0 aby uzyskać dostęp do sieci. Dla wielu będzie to niezbyt optymalne rozwiązanie ale na początek wystarczy (niecierpliwi mogą zerknąć do dokumentacji Xen\u0026rsquo;a aby sprawdzić inne opcje XenNetworking\u0026thinsp; external link ).\nDodatkowa opcja antispoof=yes aktywuje firewall, który uniemożliwi systemom domU przypisywanie sobie adresów innych systemów domU. By to działało w konfiguracji maszyny wirtualnej w definicji interfejsu (vif) należy przypisać adres IP danemu systemowi domU.\nNa moim systemie nie wszystkie skrypty dla konfiguracji sieci miały atrybut do wykonywania co skutkowało błędami przy uruchamianiu domU (np. \u0026ldquo;missing vif-script, or network-script, in the Xen configuration file\u0026rdquo;). By temu zapobiec ustawmy wszystkim skryptom odpowiednie uprawnienia:\nchmod +x /etc/xen/scripts/* W pliku /etc/xen/xend-config.sxp można ponadto ustawić jak dużo pamięci i procesorów rezerwujemy dla systemu dom0. Ilość pamięci dla dom0 można ograniczyć dodając opcję dom0_mem dla kernela w zmiennej GRUB_CMDLINE_XEN w konfiguracji gruba.\nNiektórzy zalecają wyłączenie dom0-balloning (czyli zajmowania przez dom0 całej pozostałej pamięci po uruchomieniu systemów domU), a zamiast tego przydzielenie minimalnej ilości pamięci, np. tak:\n(dom0-min-mem 1024) (enable-dom0-ballooning no) Ja osobiście wolę pozostawić balloning włączony - po co blokować ram skoro nikt inny z niego nie skorzysta, a tak to przynajmniej jest więcej na bufory dyskowe 😉\nUstawienie konsoli By mieć dostęp do wyjścia z GRUB\u0026rsquo;a, Xen hypervisor\u0026rsquo;a, kernela i getty poprzez VGA i konsolę należy dokonać zmian w pliku /etc/default/grub jak poniżej:\nGRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND=\u0026#34;serial --unit=0 --speed=9600 --word=8 --parity=no --stop=1\u0026#34; GRUB_TERMINAL=\u0026#34;console serial\u0026#34; GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 GRUB_CMDLINE_XEN=\u0026#34;com1=9600,8n1 console=com1,vga\u0026#34; GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\u0026#34;console=tty0 console=hvc0\u0026#34; A następnie w /etc/inittab aktualizujemy linijki:\n1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 hvc0 2:23:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1 # NO getty on ttyS0! W ten sposób tty1 pokazuje wyjście VGA, a hvc0 kosolę. Standardowo po modyfikacji opcji gruba musimy wykonać aktualizację poleceniem:\nupdate-grub Jeśli nic nie skopaliśmy to po restarcie powinniśmy otrzymać hypervisora gotowego do uruchamiania DomU.\nŹródła http://wiki.debian.org/Xen\u0026thinsp; external link ","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2012/02/xen-na-squeeze-instalacja-i-konfiguracja-hypervisora/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"po-co-mi-to\"\u003ePo co mi to?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiele razy miałem do czynienia z serwerami na których działało kilka/kilkanaście usług równocześnie, np.

InnoDB - kompaktowanie plików W domyślnej konfiguracji MySQL dla baz InnoDB (na Debianie na bank, przypuszczam że na innych distro jest podobnie) wszystkie tabele, indeksy, metadane tabel i inne dane dotyczące table InnoDB przechowywane są w jednym pliku: /var/lib/mysql/ibdata1\nNie jest to optymalne ustawienie szczególnie gdy mamy dużo baz i o znacznych rozmiarach - wykonywanie wielu równoczesnych operacji na jednym gigantycznym pliku potrafi mocno przymulić.\nPróba kompaktowania/optymalizowania tabel InnoDB nie powoduje zmniejszenia tego pliku - bo gdy próbujemy optymalizować tabele InnoDB powoduje to:\nułożenie danych i indeksów wewnątrz pliku ibdata1 w sposób ciągły, wzrost rozmiaru pliku ibdata1 ponieważ powyższe dane dopisywane są na jego końcu. Niewiele osób spodziewa się takiego rezultatu. Można zmniejszyć rozmiar tego pliku wyłączając dane tabel i ich indeksy do osobnych plików ale proces ten wymaga pełnego backupu bazy i jej odtworzenia, wiąże się więc z chwilowym (a w przypadku dużych baz - dłuższym) przestojem.\nRobimy pełny backup bazy, np. poleceniem: mysqldump --all-databases --single-transaction -uroot -p \u0026gt; my-dump.sql (dump\u0026rsquo;a można dodatkowo skompresować gzipem dodając pipe\u0026rsquo;a - przyspieszy to odzyskiwanie przez zmniejszenie ilości danych potrzebnych do odczytania z dysku)\nKasujemy wszystkie bazy z wyjątkiem schematu mysql (de facto powinno wystarczyć skasowanie i odzyskanie tylko baz korzystających z tabel InnoDB)\nWyłączamy usługę:\ninvoke-rc.d mysql stop Dodajemy w pliku /etc/mysql/my.cnf parametry: [mysqld] innodb_file_per_table innodb_log_file_size=25% xG innodb_buffer_pool_size=xG pierwsza opcja powoduje właściwe rozdzielenie tabel InnoDB do różnych plików (dodanie tej opcji na serwerze na którym znajdują się bazy InnoDB spowoduje ich uszkodzenie - odradzam), drugą i trzecią linijkę konfigurujemy według wcześniejszej instrukcji o innodb_buffer_pool_size, możemy też na czas przywracania danych dodać opcję bulk_insert_buffer_size=256M, skróci to czas potrzebny na przywrócenie bazy. Kasujemy pliki: ibdata1, ib_logfile0 and ib_logfile1: rm /var/lib/mysql/ibdata1 rm /var/lib/mysql/ib_logfile[01] Uruchamiamy serwer MySQL: invoke-rc.d mysql start Przywracamy wszystkie bazy z dump\u0026rsquo;a: cat my-dump.sql | mysql -uroot -p Plik ibdata1 urośnie ale od tej pory będzie zawierać wyłącznie metadane tabel a poszczególne tabele i indeksy będą przechowywane w osobnych plikach, np. tabela.ibd. Teraz optymalizowanie tabel InnoDB będzie powodować zmniejszenie rozmiarów plików *.ibd a plik ibdata1 nie będzie tak obciążony.\nZmiana metody flush\u0026rsquo;a W niektórych przypadkach ustawienie opcji innodb_flush_method na wartość O_DIRECT może poprawić wydajność, choć w innych wydajność może się pogorszyć (na forach sugerowano występowanie problemu na dedykowanych macierzach). Można bezpiecznie włączyć tę opcję i wykonać kilka bechmarków:\n[mysqld] innodb_flush_method=O_DIRECT Cache wyników zapytań Sprawdźmy najpierw czy cachowanie jest włączone (u mnie było to domyślne ustawienie), wydajemy zapytanie:\nSHOW VARIABLES LIKE \u0026#39;query_cache_type\u0026#39;; Możliwe są 3 ustawienia:\nON (query_cache_type = 1) - cachowanie wszystkich zapytań, OFF (query_cache_type = 0) - cachowanie na żądanie, DEMAND (query_cache_type = 2) - cachowanie wyłączone. W przypadku opcji DEMAND cachowanie jest włączane jeżeli po SELECT\u0026rsquo;cie dodamy SQL_CACHE. Mi osobiście najbardziej odpowiada opcja z cachowaniem wszystkiego.\nNastępnie należy ustawić w pliku my.cnf poniższe zmienne według potrzeb:\nquery_cache_limit = 2M query_cache_size = 32M Pierwsza opcja ustala maksymalny rozmiar pojedynczego zapytanie, które będzie cachowane - zapytania większe nie będą cachowane. Druga opcja ustala rozmiar całego bufora na cache (przeważnie więcej działa lepiej).\nMyISAM - unikanie repair with keycache Gdy nasza baza urośnie i będziemy mieć w niej tabele o rozmiarze przekraczającym 2GB to da się zauważyć że pewne operacja jak np. zakładanie indeksu, optymalizacja, naprawa - trwają cholernie długo. Można to szczególnie odczuć właśnie w momencie przekraczania rozmiaru 2GB i tak utworzenie indeksu na tabeli o rozmiarze 1,9GB trwa powiedzmy kilkanaście/kilkadziesiąt minut, a ta sama operacja na bazie o rozmiarze 2,1GB może zająć nawet kilka godzin.\nPrzyczynę łatwo namierzyć obserwując wynik polecenia:\nSHOW PROCESSLIST; w trakcie operacji na \u0026ldquo;małej\u0026rdquo; i \u0026ldquo;dużej\u0026rdquo; tabeli. \u0026ldquo;Mała\u0026rdquo; zatrzymuje się na dłużej na operacji Repair By Sorting, a \u0026ldquo;duża\u0026rdquo; kona godzinami na Repair With Keycache. Właśnie różnica w działaniu obu mechanizmów sortowania daje w kość:\nrepair by sorting - wykorzystuje do sortowania wiele plików tymczasowych i wymaga sporo wolnego miejsca w katalogu ustawionym w opcji tmpdir (domyślnie ustawionej na /tmp) - jeżeli miejsca będzie za mało to wybierany będzie mechanizm \u0026ldquo;repair with keycache\u0026rdquo;, repair with keycache - wykorzystuje do sortowania bardzo mały bufor (u mnie 8MB), jest ok 10~20 krotnie wolniejszy niż \u0026ldquo;repair by sorting\u0026rdquo; a do tego tworzy mniej optymalne indeksy. O tym który z mechanizmów zostanie wybrany decyduje opcja myisam_max_sort_file_size - zmienna ta ma domyślnie wartość 2GB i właśnie dlatego problemy pojawiają się po przekroczeniu tego rozmiaru. Proponuję ustawić ją sporo powyżej rozmiaru największych tablic - oczywiście jeśli miejsce w temp\u0026rsquo;ie pozwoli na to, np:\nmyisam_max_sort_file_size=8GB Przy takim ustawieniu warto mieć w /tmp minimum drugie tyle wolnego miejsca.\nŹródło http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/3163/mysql-5-1-innodb-configuration-24gb-ram-bi-xeon-high-load\u0026thinsp; external link ","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2011/12/mysql-proste-metody-optymalizacji/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWcześniej czy później zawsze pojawia się potrzeba zoptymalizowania naszej bazy MySQL.

Aktualizacje pojawiały się rzadko a od czasu do czasu miewałem problemy ze stabilnością tej wtyczki na kilku bardziej skomplikowanych aplikacjach. Zdarzało się że pomimo zmiany kodu w skrypcie php, eAccelerator serwował wciąż stary plik - konieczny był restart Apache\u0026rsquo;go by wszystko działało jak trzeba.\nZacząłem szukać alternatywy i trafiłem na dwa moduły:\nAPC\u0026thinsp; external link (czyli Alternative PHP Cache), który ma być nawet domyślnie wbudowany w PHP od wersji 5.4, XCache\u0026thinsp; external link - projekt rozwijany przez jednego z programistów lighttpd. Byłem ciekaw wydajności poszczególnych rozwiązań względem siebie, więc przygotowałem małe środowisko testowe składające się z 4 maszyn wirtualnych (działających pod kontrolą VirtualBox\u0026rsquo;a):\nApache 2.2 + PHP 5.3 Apache 2.2 + PHP 5.3 + eAccelerator 0.9.6.1 (instrukcja instalacji tutaj\u0026thinsp; external link ) Apache 2.2 + PHP 5.3 + APC 3.1.3p1 (pod Debianem paczka php-apc) Apache 2.2 + PHP 5.3 + XCache 1.3.0 (pod Debianem paczka php5-xcache) Najpierw przygotowałem pierwszą maszynę wraz z konfiguracją MySQL\u0026rsquo;a i domyślną instalacją WordPress\u0026rsquo;a 3.2 by test był w miarę miarodajny. Kolejne maszynki to klony tej pierwszej, plus zainstalowane i domyślnie skonfigurowane kolejne rozszerzenia. Każdemu z rozszerzeń przyznałem 32 MB pamięci na cache.\nMetodyka testu Do automatyzacji testu posłużył mi skrypt w bash\u0026rsquo;u uruchamiający ab dla 1000 zapytań z kolejno rosnącą liczbą równoległych połączeń. Pozwoli to na porównanie wydajności optymalizatorów przy mniejszym i większym obciążeniu. Uruchomienie testu dla czystej instalacji bez dodatku pokaże jak duży przyrost wydajności daje się uzyskać.\nJako systemy testowe posłużyły mi wirtualki uruchomione pod kontrolą VirtualBOX\u0026rsquo;a z zainstalowanym aktualnym Debianem Squeeze. Przydzieliłem im po 1 GB RAM\u0026rsquo;u i 2 rdzenie CPU. Wirtualki te raczej nie są highend\u0026rsquo;em ale do ogólnego porównania optymalizatorów będą w zupełności wystarczające.\nWyniki Już na pierwszy rzut oka widać że opłaca się zainstalować dowolny optymalizator bo ich wydajność jest zbliżona a w stosunku do czystej instalacji pozwalają obsłużyć prawie czterokrotnie większy ruch. Przy czym system bez opcode cacher\u0026rsquo;a nie pokonał granicy 70 zapytań na sekundę - zaczął swapować i nie ukończył kolejnych testów.\nPoniżej wykres przedstawiający ilość obsługiwanych żądań w zależności od ilości równoczesnych połączeń: I jeszcze jeden wykres, na którym porównałem wydajność poszczególnych optymalizatorów względem czystego PHP\u0026rsquo;a Wychodzi na to że przez większość testu eAccelerator był najszybszy, gdzieniegdzie przeplatając się z APC. XCache nieznacznie ale na całej długości poniżej dwóch wcześniejszych. Całościowe różnice pomiędzy optymalizatorami przeważnie nie przekraczały 3 zapytań/sekundę - więc różnice pomiędzy nimi są rzędu 1~2%. Można na tej podstawie wywnioskować że wydajność jest tak zbliżona iż nie powinna być jedynym kryterium wyboru optymalizatora dla naszego systemu.\nPoniżej postaram się zebrać subiektywne oceny poszczególnych rozwiązań by dostarczyć dodatkowych argumentów.\neAccelerator eAccelerator był najszybszy w teście ale miewałem z nim problemy (kilka razy ale\u0026hellip;) stąd nie jest moim faworytem.\nZalety:\nzdecydowanie najszybszy, jest stosunkowo aktywnie rozwijany, dość stabilny, wbudowany encoder i dekoder skryptów (do dystrybucji kodu bez źródeł w postaci skompilowanej). Wady:\nbrak paczek w repozytoriach Debiana - ręczna kompilacja nie jest ciężka ale gdy trzeba go utrzymać na 30 serwerach to przestaje być zabawnie, pomimo że pojawiają się nowe wersje to ostatnio miałem problemy z pobraniem ich ze strony projektu - szukanie paczek \u0026ldquo;gdzieś\u0026rdquo; na sieci nie wydaje mi się bezpieczne, miałem problem z pewną dużą aplikacją, nie działała stabilnie pod eAcceleratorem, eAccelerator powstał na bazie kodu Turck MMCache (ten nie jest już rozwijany) -istnieją pewne wątpliwości licencyjne co do jego kodu\u0026hellip; PHP APC APC pod względem wydajności nieznacznie ustępuje eAcceleratorowi. Ciekawą funkcją udostępnianą przez APC jest obsługa RFC1867 (File Upload Progress hook handler). Jest też pewna potwierdzona plotka mówiąca o włączeniu kodu APC do PHP\u0026rsquo;a 6. Teoretycznie jeżeli przesiądziemy się już teraz na APC to później powinno pójść łatwiej\u0026hellip;\nZalety:\ndość szybki, aktywnie rozwijany, bardzo stabilny, dostępna paczka w repozytoriach Debiana (i z tego co wiem na wielu innych systemach też przeważnie wystarczają domyślne repozytoria) obsługa RFC1867 (upload progress), zostanie włączony do PHP od wersji 5.4, APC udostępnia API umożliwiające tworzenie własnych obiektów w pamięci cache współdzielonych pomiędzy zapytaniami np. by nie pobierać za każdym razem właściwości profilu z bazy, listy użytkowników, itp (coś w stylu memcached). dostępny jest ze skryptem apc.php, który pozwala zarządzać obiektami w cache, czyścić itp. Wady:\npodobno bywa problematyczny w konfiguracji z fast-cgi (choć u mnie działa), przy mocno zapchanym cache\u0026rsquo;u czyszczenie go potrafiło się zwiesić. XCache Ostatni projekt rozwijany jest przez jednego z programistów lighttpd. W chwili obecnej wydaje się być dość dojrzałym i wystarczająco stabilnym do produkcyjnego użycia. Choć gdy próbowałem z niego korzystać jakiś rok/dwa temu to miałem sporo losowych padów - niezależnych od obciążenia serwera.\nZalety:\nstabilny, aktywnie rozwijany z kilkoma gałęziami (stable/unstable/devel) - możemy wybrać czy potrzebujemy funkcji czy stabilności. Wady:\nnieznacznie, ale jednak najniższa wydajność, miałem z nim mało styczności a szybko zraziłem się do kiepskiej stabilności - obecnie wydaje się że nie stanowi to problemu. Podsumowanie i mój wybór Do testu celowo wybrałem WordPress\u0026rsquo;a jako dość duży i wystarczająco skomplikowany projekt - jeśli on będzie działać stabilnie to większość mniejszych też powinna\u0026hellip; Ku mojemu zaskoczeniu żaden z optymalizatorów nie sypnął błędami. Dziwiło mnie to bo jeszcze jakiś czas temu eAccelerator czasami losowo mi się sypał - działał przez tydzień i nagle zgon w sobotę po południu\u0026hellip; Później próbowałem XCache i było podobnie\u0026hellip; tylko gorzej bo problemy występowały częściej. APC testowałem jako ostatnie ale w wykorzystywanych przeze mnie aplikacjach zachowywał się bardzo stabilnie i przewidywalni. Jedyny problem z wieszaniem się podczas czyszczenia/usuwania elementu z cache\u0026rsquo;u można obejść stosunkowo szybkim restartem Apachego - skuteczne i efekt ten sam \u0026#x1f603; Na jednym z serwerów testuję APC w trybie fast-cgi od około dwóch miesięcy i jak na razie nie mogę narzekać (może w wolnej chwili uzupełnię to zestawienie o testy w trybie fast-cgi).\nObecnie w większości administrowanych przeze mnie serwerów z PHP\u0026rsquo;em standardowo instaluję APC. Wybór jest dla mnie tym bardziej oczywisty że paczka ta jest dostępna w standardowych repozytoriach (łatwość aktualizacji itd) - nie ma zatem potrzeby jak w przypadku eAcceleratora instalowania wielu paczek z zależnościami by móc skompilować 1 moduł.\nDodatkową zaletą jest fakt że APC ma być standardowo wbudowany w kolejne wersje PHP\u0026rsquo;a - jeżeli w rozwijanych aplikacjach już teraz zwróci się uwagę na integrację z tym rozwiązaniem to w przyszłości migracja nie powinna przysporzyć problemów.\nJeżeli się wahasz - wybierz APC. Jeżeli w Twoim środowisku okaże się niestabilne zawsze możesz spróbować dwóch pozostałych rozwiązań.\nPrzydatne linki (część potwierdza moje obserwacje, są też testy z drupalem):\nhttp://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php\u0026thinsp; external link http://xcache.lighttpd.net/\u0026thinsp; external link http://eaccelerator.net/\u0026thinsp; external link (w chwili pisanie strona nie działała \u0026#x1f603;)\nhttp://www.ducea.com/2006/10/30/php-accelerators/\u0026thinsp; external link http://2bits.com/articles/benchmarking-drupal-with-php-op-code-caches-apc-eaccelerator-and-xcache-compared.html\u0026thinsp; external link http://2bits.com/articles/benchmarking-apc-vs-eaccelerator-using-drupal.html\u0026thinsp; external link http://hostingfu.com/article/increasing-php-application-performance-xcache\u0026thinsp; external link ","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2011/11/porownanie-optymalizatorow-php-eaccelerator-php-apc-xcache/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePrzez pewien czas korzystałem z eAcceleratora do przyspieszenia działania stron pisanych w PHP\u0026rsquo;ie ale czasem bywał niestabilny.

Kilka z możliwych funkcji to:\nr - przełącz klawiaturę z trybu RAW do XLATE (w wolnym tłumaczeniu: odzyskaj obsługę klawiatury od X\u0026rsquo;ów), e - wyślij SIGTERM do wszystkich procesów z wyjątkiem init\u0026rsquo;a, i - wyślij SIGKILL do wszystkich procesów z wyjątkiem init\u0026rsquo;a, s - wywołaj sync dla wszystkich zamontowanych zasobów (czyli zapisz wszystkie niezapisane dotąd transakcje dyskowe), u - przemontuj wszystkie zamontowane zasoby to trybu tylko do odczytu, b - natychmiast uruchom ponownie system, bez odmontowania partycji i bez synchronizacji dysków. To tylko część funkcji, ale wykonanie ich w kolejności w jakiej zostały tu wypisane (czyli reisub) powinno skutkować STOSUNKOWO bezpiecznym resetem, po którym nawet nie powinno być potrzebne skanowanie dysków fsck\u0026rsquo;iem. Każda z funkcji potrzebuje kilka/kilkanaście sekund na wykonanie (szczególnie warto zaczekać by po sync\u0026rsquo;u przestała migać kontrolka aktywności dysków twardych) - nie warto się spieszyć. Po ostatnim wywołaniu system powinien się zrestartować - zdarzyło mi się tylko kilka razy by procedura ta zawiodła.\nMetodę można też wykorzystać dla serwerów zdalnych, które np. z jakiegoś powodu nie chcą się zrestartować w standardowy sposób. Można to zrobić wysyłając poszczególne polecenia do /proc/sysrq-trigger, np. tak:\necho b \u0026gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger Na zdalnych maszynach i VPS\u0026rsquo;ach wygodniejsze może być skonfigurowanie demona sysrqd.\nDla zainteresowanych, więcej funkcji Magic SysRq (głównie diagnostycznych) i dokładniejszy opis można znaleźć na stronie wiki\u0026thinsp; external link .\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2011/09/magic-sysrq-bezpieczny-reset-linuxa/","summary":"\u003cp\u003ePomimo iż Linux uchodzi za stabilne środowisko to raz na jakiś czas trafi się ciężka zwiecha - z powodu przeciążenia, awarii sprzętu\u0026hellip; nieistotne\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZałóżmy że licho wzięło za cel główny serwer plików lub bazę danych dla wielu, wielu stron internetowych.

Pośredniczy on w pobieraniu plików zapisując kopię każdego w lokalnym cache\u0026rsquo;u. Czyli pierwsze pobranie zasysa paczkę z sieci, a kolejne odwołania do approx\u0026rsquo;a serwują już tę pobraną kopię. Ponadto przyjemne jest zachowanie approx\u0026rsquo;a, który samodzielnie utrzymuje \u0026ldquo;czystość\u0026rdquo; cachu usuwając starsze paczki i aktualizując nowe. Druga wielka zaleta tej aplikacji to lokalne składowanie tylko tych paczek które pobieramy - bo mało kto potrzebuje całego repozytorium - drastycznie zmniejsza to rozmiar takiego mirror\u0026rsquo;a. U mnie mirror ma raptem kilkaset megabajtów.\nInstalacja i konfiguracja Ponieważ paczka jest w domyślnych repozytoriach wystarczy:\napt-get install approx i po chwili mamy działające proxy.\nDomyślnie pliki składowane są w: /var/cache/approx - warto zadbać o odrobinę wolnego miejsca w tej lokalizacji.\nNależy jeszcze skonfigurować odpowiednie repozytoria w pliku konfiguracyjnym: /etc/approx/approx.conf - u mnie wygląda on tak:\ndebian http://ftp.pl.debian.org/debian security http://security.debian.org/debian-security volatile http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile backports http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports # The following are the default parameter values, so there is # no need to uncomment them unless you want a different value. # See approx.conf(5) for details. $interface any $port 8080 $max_wait 30 #$max_rate unlimited #$user approx #$group approx #$syslog daemon #$pdiffs true #$verbose false #$debug true Po instalacji approx działa na porcie 8080 o czym trzeba pamiętać przy podawaniu URL\u0026rsquo;i w sources.list - mi to odpowiadało bo na porcie 80-tym mam odpalony serwer WWW pod jakieś śmieci\u0026hellip; Ale Wam może odpowiadać uruchomienie approx\u0026rsquo;a na 80-tce.\nTeraz restartujemy approx\u0026rsquo;a by przeładować konfigurację:\ninvoke-rc.d approx restart Zostało skonfigurować plik /etc/apt/sources.list tak by wskazywał na nasze proxy.

Atak polega na uruchomieniu wielu równoczesnych sesji i bardzo wolnym wysyłaniu komunikatów HTTP. Atakujący udaje \u0026ldquo;klienta z wolnym łączem\u0026rdquo; równocześnie uruchamiając kolejne sesje by po pewnym czasie zająć wszystkie dostępne. Serwer WWW przestaje wtedy odpowiadać na zapytania od innych klientów. Dodatkowo na źle wyskalowanych serwerach duża liczba procesów Apachego może spowodować swapowanie i błędy braku pamięci.\nW zależności od wydajności atakowanej maszyny by doprowadzić do jej zablokowania potrzeba przeważnie od kilkunastu do kilkudziesięciu sekund. Tak przeprowadzony atak DOS nie wymaga botnetu czy super wydajnego sprzętu - zwykły lapciak w zupełności wystarczy.\nNa chwilę obecną są już co najmniej dwie metody ochrony Apachego przed takim atakiem: mod_antiloris\u0026thinsp; external link i mod_reqtimeout\u0026thinsp; external link . Pierwszy dostępny jako moduł do ręcznej kompilacji dla starszych wersji Apache (np. w Debianie Lennym). Drugi dostępny jest w standardzie od wersji 2.2.15 (np. w Debianie Squeeze).\nmod_antiloris pozwala na limitowanie ilości równoczesnych sesji dla zdalnego klienta. W przypadku przekroczenia dozwolonej liczby zrywane jest połączenie. Ma to swoje wady, np. gdy z naszego serwera WWW korzysta jakaś duża NAT\u0026rsquo;owana sieć to przy większej liczbie połączeń zostaną zablokowani \u0026ldquo;dobrzy\u0026rdquo; klienci. Trudne jest też właściwe ustawienie maksymalnej liczby połączeń - domyślnie ustawiona jest wartość 5.

Wiedząc, że AWStats działają jako skrypt CGI wystawianie takiego serwisu \u0026ldquo;na świat\u0026rdquo; nie wydaje mi się bezpiecznym rozwiązaniem.

W moim przypadku żaden z wystawianych przezemnie serwisów nie korzysta z CGI, więc udostępnianie tych skryptów wszystkim \u0026ldquo;zainteresowanym\u0026rdquo; nie ma sensu.\nProponuję wykorzystać taki lub podobny plik konfiguracyjny dla hosta serwującego statystyki:\n\u0026lt;VirtualHost *:80\u0026gt; ServerName staty.domena.pl ServerAdmin webmaster@domena.pl DocumentRoot /var/www/stats/ \u0026lt;Directory /\u0026gt; Options FollowSymLinks AllowOverride None \u0026lt;/Directory\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Directory /var/www/stats/\u0026gt; Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews AllowOverride None Order Deny,Allow Deny from all Allow from 192.168.1.0/24 \u0026lt;/Directory\u0026gt; ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ \u0026lt;Directory \u0026#34;/usr/lib/cgi-bin\u0026#34;\u0026gt; AllowOverride None Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch Order Deny,Allow Deny from all Allow from 192.168.1.0/24 \u0026lt;/Directory\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Directory /var/lib/awstats\u0026gt; Options None AllowOverride None Order Deny,Allow Deny from all Allow from 192.168.1.0/24 \u0026lt;/Directory\u0026gt; Alias /awstats-icon/ /usr/share/awstats/icon/ \u0026lt;Directory /usr/share/awstats/icon\u0026gt; Options None AllowOverride None Order Deny,Allow Deny from all Allow from 192.168.1.0/24 \u0026lt;/Directory\u0026gt; ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log LogLevel warn CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined \u0026lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c\u0026gt; RewriteEngine On RewriteCond $1 !^$ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !.*cgi-bin RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !.*awstats.pl RewriteRule /(.*)/? /cgi-bin/awstats.pl?config=$1 [PT] RewriteRule ^/awstats.pl(.*?) /cgi-bin/awstats.pl$1 [QSA,R,L] \u0026lt;/IfModule\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/VirtualHost\u0026gt; Z ważnych rzeczy do personalizacji:\nServerName - wpisz swoją nazwę serwisu, Allow from 192.168.1.0/24 - zamień na adres/adresy, które Tobie odpowiadają, mod_rewrite - ostatnich kilka linijek wykorzystuje mod_rewrite do uproszczenia odwołań do statystyk, wystarczy wtedy wpisać adres np. tak: http://staty.domena.pl/nazwa.domeny.ktora.nas.interesuje.pl\u0026thinsp; external link plik zapisujemy jako /etc/apache2/sites-available/awstats Teraz zostało nam uaktywnienie site\u0026rsquo;a:\na2ensite awstats Część wspólna konfiguracji Teraz tworzymy katalog na skrypt, który wypisze nam dostępne statystyki:\nmkdir /var/www/stats chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/stats/ Właściwa konfiguracja AWStats Pliki konfiguracyjne AWStats znajdują się w katalogu /etc/awstats. Jest ich dokładnie 2 szt.:\nawstats.conf awstats.conf.local Plik awstats.conf zawiera przykładową konfigurację wystarczającą do odpalenia statystyk dla pojedynczego hosta. Z kolei plik awstats.conf.local jest miejscem gdzie można wrzucić wspólną konfigurację dla kilku plików hostów.\nJeżeli mamy wiele hostów (a taki przypadek tutaj omawiam) to wygodniej będzie nam wrzucić cały plik awstats.conf do awstats.conf.local i w kolejnych plikach konfiguracyjnych zmieniać tylko parametry rozróżniające poszczególne hosty. Robimy więc tak:\nmv /etc/awstats/awstats.conf.local /etc/awstats/awstats.conf.local.orig mv /etc/awstats/awstats.conf /etc/awstats/awstats.conf.local Teraz musimy zmienić kilka linijek w pliku awstats.conf.local:\n# musimy odszukać i zakomentować poniższe linie LogFile=\u0026#34;/var/log/apache/access.log\u0026#34; SiteDomain=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; HostAliases=\u0026#34;localhost 127.0.0.1\u0026#34; Include \u0026#34;/etc/awstats/awstats.conf.local\u0026#34; # w ten sposób #LogFile=\u0026#34;/var/log/apache/access.log\u0026#34; #SiteDomain=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; #HostAliases=\u0026#34;localhost 127.0.0.1\u0026#34; #Include \u0026#34;/etc/awstats/awstats.conf.local\u0026#34; # dodatkowo odszukujemy linię LogFormat=4 # i zamieniamy na LogFormat=1 Teraz możemy utworzyć pliki konfiguracyjne dla naszych vhostów raptem w kilku linijkach, np.:\nLogFile=\u0026#34;/var/log/apache2/access.log\u0026#34; SiteDomain=\u0026#34;domena.pl\u0026#34; HostAliases=\u0026#34;www.domena.pl\u0026#34; Include \u0026#34;/etc/awstats/awstats.conf.local\u0026#34; Oczywiście trzeba wpisać własną lokalizację pliku access.log. W powyższym przypadku jest to lokalizacja domyślna, wspólna dla wszystkich vhostów - rozróżnienie ruchu do poszczególnych vhostów następuje dzięki podaniu parametrów SiteDomain (podstawowej domeny danej strony) oraz HostAliases (innych domen wskazujących na tego samego vhosta).\nOstatnim elementem jest załadowanie pliku ze wspólną konfiguracją.\nZmiana uprawnień do logów Aby umożliwić dostęp AWStats do logów serwera Apache musimy wykonać dwie czynności. Na początek zmiana atrybutu dla aktualnego pliku log:\nchmod o+r /var/log/apache2/access.log Później musimy zadbać aby logi po rotacji przez logrotate również zachowywały atrybuty, oraz aby przed rotacją AWStats wygenerowało statystyki, których nie zebrało wcześniej. W tym celu zmieniamy plik /etc/logrotate.d/apache2 tak by wyglądał jak poniżej:\n/var/log/apache2/*.log { weekly missingok rotate 52 compress delaycompress notifempty create 644 root adm sharedscripts prerotate /usr/share/doc/awstats/examples/awstats-update endscript postrotate if [ -f /var/run/apache2.pid ]; then /etc/init.d/apache2 restart \u0026gt; /dev/null fi endscript } Przeładowanie konfiguracji Apache Po tych wszystkich zmianach w konfiguracji musimy zrestartować Apache:\ninvoke-rc.d apache2 restart Testy konfiguracji Aby sprawdzić konfigurację AWStats spróbujemy wejść na stronę:http://staty.domena.pl/cgi-bin/awstats.pl?config=domena.pl\nJeżeli na żadnym z etapów nie popełniliśmy błędu to naszym oczom powinny ukazać się \u0026ldquo;wspaniałe i upragnione statystyki\u0026rdquo; \u0026#x1f603;\nJedyną delikatną wadą awstats jest \u0026ldquo;brzydki\u0026rdquo; i długi link z cgi w środku\u0026hellip; Nieco mnie to irytowało, więc przysiadłem chwilę przy mod_rewrite i przygotowałem regułki (były podane w konfiguracji dla ambitnych), które pozwalają rozpocząć przeglądanie statystyk z uproszczonego linku postaci:\nhttp://staty.domena.pl/domena.pl\u0026thinsp; external link Proste, czyste i klarowne, bez zbędnych śmieci.\nCo prawda koniec tutora, ale nie koniec samej konfiguracji - proponuję aby przejrzeć przykładowy plik z konfiguracją i zapoznać się z zawartymi tam opcjami.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2011/08/statystyki-odwiedzin-dla-wielu-serwisow-z-awstats/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eCo prawda na swojej stronie zrobiłem kilka podstawowych statystyk i coś tam sobie loguję do bazy danych, ale gdyby się chwilę zastanowić to przecież to samo robi serwer www - wrzuca do logów każde zapytanie HTTP, kod błędu, nazwę agenta, itd.

Nasza \u0026ldquo;prośba\u0026rdquo; po podpisaniu przez centrum autoryzacyjne stanie się certyfikatem.\nDo wygenerowania Request\u0026rsquo;u potrzebny jest najpierw klucz prywatny, który generujemy np. tak:\nopenssl genrsa -aes256 -out priv.key 4096 Powyższe polecenie poprosi nas dwa razy o hasło, które trzeba zapamiętać (albo zapisać i zamknąć w sejfie) - zalecam wykorzystanie pseudolosowego ciągu znaków o długości minimum 10 znaków.\nPo genrsa możemy użyć kilku opcji wybierając w ten sposób algorytm szyfrujący - do wyboru są: des, des3, aes128, aes192, aes256. Ja wybrałem 256-bitowego AES\u0026rsquo;a - najmocniejszy z tych algorytmów.\nOstatni parametr do długość klucza. Można użyć innej wartości np. 1024. Klucz wygeneruje się szybciej ale będzie prostszy do złamania. Z moich doświadczeń wynika, że niektóre aplikacje mogą mieć problem z obsługą długiego klucza (np. jak użyty w tym przykładzie), wtedy użycie mniejszej wartości może być konieczne (lepsze słabsze zabezpieczenie niż żadne).\nWarto ograniczyć uprawnienia do wygenerowanego klucza prywatnego tak by tylko właściciel miał do niego dostęp:\nchmod 400 priv.key Przy okazji tworzenia klucza prywatnego warto wspomnieć, że jeżeli będziemy chcieli go użyć w tak przygotowanej postaci np. w Apache\u0026rsquo;m to przy każdym starcie Apache będzie nas prosić o podanie hasła odbezpieczającego klucz prywatny. Niby to bezpieczne ale z drugiej strony przez takie zabezpieczenie Apache nie podniesie się samodzielnie np. po awarii. Rozwiązaniem jest przygotowanie odszyfrowanej wersji klucza prywatnego, z której będzie korzystał Apache. Robi się to tak:\nopenssl rsa -in priv.key -out priv.unsecure.key chmod 400 priv.unsecure.key Klucz priv.unsecure.key podany w konfiguracji programu nie będzie wymagał hasła. Koniecznie należy uniemożliwić dostęp do tego pliku wszystkim z wyjątkiem root\u0026rsquo;a!\nopenssl req -new -key priv.key -out request.csr Co dalej? Ok. Mamy już request\u0026rsquo;a, warto w tym miejscu wspomnieć co możemy z nim zrobić:\nMożemy taki plik przesłać do centrum autoryzacji (CA) celem podpisania i wygenerowania certyfiaktu. Klucze publiczne CA takich jak Thawte, VeriSign, itp są dołączane do przeglądarek internetowych, OS\u0026rsquo;ów, etc. dzięki temu strony internetowe (bądź inne usługi) zabezpieczone takimi certyfikatami weryfikują się bez żadnej dodatkowej akcji ze strony użytkownika. Warto wziąć pod uwagę to rozwiązanie, jeżeli np. chcemy zabezpieczyć sklep internetowy - my odpuścimy to rozwiązanie ze względu na koszty \u0026#x1f603; Drugą opcją jest możliwość samodzielnego podpisania certyfikatu tworząc tzw. SelfSigned Certificate. To zalecana opcja jeżeli mamy tylko jedną stronę/usługę. Użytkownik raz doda sobie nasz certyfikat jako zaufany i będzie mógł korzystać z szyfrowania do woli. Metoda ta robi się problematyczna gdy trzeba zarządzać większą liczbą certyfikatów. Ostatnia opcja to utworzenie własnego CA (czyli specjalnego certyfikatu), którym będziemy podpisywać wygenerowane przez nas Requesty. Ma to tę zaletę, że wystarczy rozdystrybuować klucz publiczny CA i będzie to wystarczające do weryfikacji wszystkich naszych certyfikatów. Tworzenie certyfikatów SelfSigned Zaczniemy od prostszej wersji czyli podpiszemy nasz request wygenerowanym przez nas wcześniej kluczem prywatnym tworzac tzw. SelfSigned Certificate. Aby to zrobić potrzebne jest takie polecenie:\nopenssl x509 -req -days 365 -in request.csr \\ -signkey priv.key -out certificate.crt Tak oto wygenerowaliśmy certyfikat certificate.crt ważny przez 365 dni (tutaj dowolność ustawień ale 1 rok to sensowny okres).\nWłaściwości certyfikatu można sprawdzić np. tak:\nopenssl x509 -noout -text -in certificate.crt Tworzenie własnego CA Najpierw należy utworzyć klucz prywatny naszego CA, robi się to dokładnie tak samo jak w przypadku generowanego wcześniej klucza prywatnego dla serwera. Później musimy wygenerować requesta (analogicznie jak w przypadku certyfikatu SelfSigned). Czyli dwa polecenia:\nopenssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca.key 4096 openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 \\ -key ca.key -out ca.crt Skoro mamy już certyfikat naszego CA, możemy podpisać wcześniej wygenerowany Request dla serwera:\nopenssl x509 -req -days 365 -in request.csr -CA ca.crt \\ -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 01 -out certificate.crt Ogólnie podpisywanie przebiega podobnie jak przy certyfikatach SelfSigned ale jak widać wykorzystywane są klucze naszego CA i pojawia się nowy parametr: set_serial, którego wartość musi być inna dla każdego podpisanego przez to CA certyfikatu.

Rozwiązanie to wyszukałem gdy chcąc skonfigurować dwa serwery apache do współpracy na rzecz jednego serwisu okazało się, że sejse trzymane są tylko przez jeden serwer a drugi nic o nich nie wie. To oczywiście nie pozwalało na prawidłowe działanie jakiegokolwiek serwisu korzystającego z sesji.\nPomysł jest taki, że zastępujemy domyśny mechanizm przechowywania sesji w plikach na dysku mechanizmem memcache. Ponieważ memcached działa jako usługa sieciowa, różne serwery mogą się odwoływać do puli memcached i odczytywać zapisane w niej dane. W przypadku sesji - nie jest ważne, kto ją utworzył - bo po jej wysłaniu do puli memcached staje się dostępna dla wszystkich klientów php z niej korzystających.\nJednym z pierwszych pytań nasuwających się do takiej kofiguracji jest: a co jeśli serwer memcached padnie? W chwili gdy wiele serwerów apache zależy od jednego serwera memcached jego awaria unieruchamia kaskadowo wszystkie.\nDlatego wykorzystałem konfigurację z dwoma serwerami memcached. Gdy php zapisuje dane w puli memcached dane są wysyłane do wszystkich podanych serwerów (w tym przypadku dwóch). A odczytywanie polega na odpytaniu pierwszego podanego serwera, a jeśli to się nie uda to drugiego. Układ nie jest idealny (jak mamy dwa działające serwery to aż się prosi o loadbalancing) ale zmniejsza prawdopodobieństwo, że awaria pojedynczego elementu położy wszystko.\nZ moim problemem moża było sobie poradzić też inaczej, np. zmieniając mechanizm sesji na stronie na taki, który korzysta z bazy danych. O ile w przypadku jednego serwisu nie jest to duży kłopot, to już przy kilku/kilkunastu byłoby to już spore przedsięwzięcie.\nWażną zaletą tego rozwiązanie jest fakt, że nie są wymagane żadne zmiany w istniejących serwisach. Po zmianie mechanizmu w konfiguracji php wszystko powinno działać bez zmian.\nInstalacja/Konfiguracja Najpierw trzeba zainstalować i uruchomić memcached oraz rozszerzenie php5-memcachedo php\u0026rsquo;a, które da nam możliwość korzystania z niego. U mnie robi się to tak:\napt-get install memcached php5-memcache Teraz trzeba by wyedytować konfigurację /etc/memcached.conf. Poniżej wycinek z tego pliku z opcjami, które należy ustawić:\n# Maksymalna wartość pamięci w MB jaka może być # wykorzystana przez demona. # Warto dostosować do swoich potrzeb. -m 128 # Interfejs, na którym nasłuchiwać będzie usługa. # Ja dla wygody wybiorę wszystkie :) -l 0.0.0.0 # można też dostosować port do nasłuchiwania -p 11211 # użytkownika nieuprzywilejowanego # (memcached domyślnie startuje jako root) -u nobody Wprowadzamy i zapisujemy zmiany. Trzeba zrestartować serwer memcached uruchamiając:\ninvoke-rc.d memcached restart Do tego momentu musimy powtórzyć konfigurację na drugiej maszynie (bo inaczej po co klastrować sesje).\nTeraz trzeba skonfiguraować php\u0026rsquo;a aby zamiast używać sesji zapisywanych do plików, korzystał z memcached. Edytujemy php.ini, u mnie akurat w lokalizacji:/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini. Odszukujemy opcje:\nsession.save_handler = files ;session.save_path = /var/lib/php5 I zamieniamy na:\nsession.save_handler = memcache ; adresy oczywiście należy dostosować do własnych ustawień session.save_path = \u0026#34;tcp://localhost:11211, tcp://remotehost:11211\u0026#34; W kolejnym kroku edytujemy plik konfiguracyjny rozszerzenia php\u0026rsquo;a dla memcache w /etc/php5/conf.d/memcache.ini dodając takie ustawienia:\nextension=memcache.so [memcache] memcache.dbpath=\u0026#34;/var/lib/memcache\u0026#34; memcache.maxreclevel=0 memcache.maxfiles=0 memcache.archivememlim=0 memcache.maxfilesize=0 memcache.maxratio=0 ; to jedyna wymagana opcja - resztę można dostosować pod siebie ; albo zostawić domyślnie memcache.allow_failover=1 memcache.max_failover_attempts=20 memcache.default_port=11211 memcache.chunk_size=8192 memcache.hash_strategy=standard memcache.hash_function=\u0026#34;crc32\u0026#34; Więcej po poszczególnych opcjach można się dowiedzieć z dokumentacji php\u0026thinsp; external link .\nTest Jeżeli zrobiliśmy wszystko jak trzeba to sesje powinny zapisywać się z pamięci memcachedi dystrybuować na wszystkie wpisane w polu save_path serwery. Możemy to sprawdzić wykorzystując np. taki skrypt:\n\u0026lt;?php session_start(); print \u0026#34;Opcja save_handler: \u0026#34; . ini_get(\u0026#34;session.save_handler\u0026#34;) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#34;; print \u0026#34;Opcja save_path: \u0026#34; . ini_get(\u0026#34;session.save_path\u0026#34;) . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#34;; if(isset($_SESSION[\u0026#39;testowa\u0026#39;])) { print \u0026#34;Testowa sesja jest już ustawiona: \u0026#34; . $_SESSION[\u0026#39;testowa\u0026#39;] . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#34;; } else { $_SESSION[\u0026#39;testowa\u0026#39;] = \u0026#34;i wygląda, że działa dobrze\u0026#34;; print \u0026#34;Ustawiamy testową sesją wartością: \u0026#34; . $_SESSION[\u0026#39;testowa\u0026#39;] . \u0026#34;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#34;; } ?\u0026gt; Wystarczy odświeżyć skrypt kilka razy. Za pierwszym razem sesja zostanie ustawiona a kolejne odświeżenia będą już zwracały jej wartość.\nProponuję też wyłączyć jeden z serwerów memcached aby sprawdzić czy php poprawnie odwoła się do drugiego serwera.\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/2011/08/klastrowanie-sesji-php-z-memcached/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eKlastrowanie to może zbyt dumnie powiedziane.

Tolkien\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read \u0026ldquo;Hobbit\u0026rdquo; for the first time back in high school, and then again years later with my kids. It was one of the first fantasy books I ever picked up—not exactly my favourite, but definitely a solid introduction to the genre.\nThere were things that puzzled me at the time, like the difference between dwarfs and gnomes, or why \u0026ldquo;elfs\u0026rdquo; are called \u0026ldquo;elves\u0026rdquo; here. Luckily, I had friends who introduced me to the arcana of \u0026ldquo;Hobbit\u0026rdquo;,\u0026ldquo;The Lord of the Rings\u0026rdquo;123 and even the world of Forgotten Realms4. Thanks to them, I started to see the bigger picture and the connections between these universes.\nReading \u0026ldquo;Hobbit\u0026rdquo; with my kids was a different experience—seeing their reactions to Bilbo\u0026rsquo;s adventures, the dwarves\u0026rsquo; stubbornness, and the riddles with Gollum. It\u0026rsquo;s a book that works well as a first step into fantasy, even if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the depth or darkness of later Tolkien works.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re just starting your journey with fantasy, \u0026ldquo;Hobbit\u0026rdquo; is a good place to begin. For me, it was more of a gateway to richer worlds, but I still appreciate its charm and simplicity.\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nForgotten Realms \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://gagor.pro/book/2005/the-hobbit/","summary":"\u003cfigure style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\n    \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/book-cover.webp\"\n         alt=\"Cover of book The Hobbit by J.R.R.
