For one of them, I’ve been preparing a presentation or rather a workshop, about “Motivation”.\nI wanted it to be a thought-provoking, workshop-style presentation where the title itself (“Why You should not motivate people”) challenges assumptions, and the session helps team leaders reflect on how they may (unintentionally) undermine intrinsic motivation. Idea behind this topic arrived after reading the “Drive” book by Daniel H. Pink .\nWriting this post was for me a preparation process, so I could refresh the key points and enhance with examples closer to my role.\nWorkshop Plan Duration: ~60–90 minutes.\nDepends on the engagement, can scale shorter if needed. Just keep an eye on the clock and skip questions.\nAudience: Team leaders, technical managers, IT focused.\nTone: conversational, reflective, not preachy.\nOutcome: Leaders leave with self-awareness and 1-2 practical commitments.\n1. Opening \u0026 Provocation (5–10 min) Slide/Title: “Why You Should Not Motivate People?” Pause, let people react. Ask: “What comes to your mind when you read this title?” “What do you usually do when you feel your team lacks motivation?” Your prep/explanation:\nPeople expect leaders to “motivate.” The problem: most think of motivation as adding something (bonuses, speeches, pressure). Pink’s core message: people already have intrinsic motivation - we mostly need to stop blocking it.\n2. Traditional View of Motivation (10 min) Explain extrinsic motivation: “carrots and sticks” → rewards, bonuses, punishment, micromanagement. Share quick example: “If-then” rewards work for simple, mechanical tasks but backfire for complex, creative, problem-solving work (which is what we mostly do in tech). Use a quick poll or raise of hands: “Who here has offered a small incentive (bonus, position, gifts, other) to boost performance?” “Did it create lasting motivation?” Prep/explanation:\nPink refers to “Motivation 1.0” as the basic instincts: fear, hunger, sex drive - those drive all the animals, including humans. As human beings we had to challenge them to build society. This where “Maslow’s hierarchy of needs”1 might ring a bell.\nWikipedia\nAlthough, as many later scientific researches proves - order is not necessarily like that, and many people’s behaviors just don’t fit to this schema.\nAccording to Drive, external motivators narrow focus, reduce creativity, and can kill intrinsic drive.\n3. What Science Shows (10–15 min) Slide/visual: Self-Determination Theory → Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose. Explain Pink’s three pillars: Autonomy – the urge to direct our own lives. Mastery – the desire to get better at something that matters. Purpose – the yearning to be part of something bigger. Interactive moment:\nAsk: “Think about a time you felt deeply motivated at work. Was it because of a bonus? Or because you had space, challenge, and meaning?” Let 2–3 participants share stories. Your prep/explanation:\nResearch by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan (founders of Self-Determination Theory) shows that when people experience autonomy, mastery, and purpose, they perform better, are more creative, and have higher well-being.\nDeci’s Soma Puzzle Experiment (1971)2: When participants were paid to solve puzzles, their interest dropped once the payments stopped-showing that external rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation. Lepper, Greene \u0026 Nisbett (1973)3: Children who were rewarded for drawing spent less time drawing later, compared to those who drew for fun. Meta-analyses4: Deci, Koestner \u0026 Ryan (1999) reviewed 128 studies and found that tangible rewards tend to decrease intrinsic motivation for interesting tasks. These findings are the scientific backbone for Pink’s argument: leaders should focus on creating environments that support autonomy, mastery, and purpose, rather than relying on external motivators.\n4. Turning the Lens on Leaders (20–25 min) Now guide reflection with open questions. You can split participants into small groups or just do it as an open discussion.\nFor Autonomy “How much decision-making power do I give my team?” “Do I trust them enough to choose how to reach outcomes, or do I dictate the steps?” “Do I measure success by presence/obedience, or by results and ownership?” For Mastery “Do I create space for people to learn and grow, even if it slows delivery?” “Do I encourage experimentation, or do I punish mistakes?” For Purpose “Do my team members know why their work matters to the company and to customers?” “When I share goals, do I frame them as numbers to hit, or impact to make?” Your prep/explanation:\nThese are not rhetorical. Let people pause, reflect, maybe make notes. The goal is for them to feel a little uncomfortable in recognizing gaps.\n5. Practical Shifts Leaders Can Make (15–20 min) Offer concrete strategies:\nFor Autonomy:\nLet teams decide how to implement, not just what to deliver. Allow flexible work styles where possible. For Mastery:\nEncourage learning time, pair programming, innovation days. Celebrate progress, not just finished products. For Purpose:\nShare customer stories. Connect tasks to mission, not just metrics. Exercise idea:\n“Pick one pillar (autonomy, mastery, purpose). What’s one small change you could make next week in your team to strengthen it?” Have participants share in pairs or groups. 6. Additional materials I want to provide something, that everyone could try to use alone. I tried to present some flowcharts and decision trees that might help you, to address topic of motivation much easier.\nRecognizing motivation patterns Before trying to “motivate” someone, first recognize what type of motivation is currently at play. Each pattern calls for a different leadership reaction - and not all are about adding energy, sometimes it’s about removing friction.\nflowchart LR A[\"Observe team member's behavior\"] --\u003e B{\"What kind of motivation do you see?\"} B --\u003e C[Intrinsic Motivation] B --\u003e D[Extrinsic Motivation] B --\u003e E[Apathy / Disengagement] B --\u003e F[Stress-Driven Motivation] C --\u003e C1[\"Driven by curiosity or challenge\"] C --\u003e C2[\"Enjoys autonomy and mastery\"] C --\u003e C3[\"Feels connected to purpose\"] C --\u003e C4[\"✅ Leader action: Support autonomy, remove blockers, offer learning opportunities\"] D --\u003e D1[\"Motivated by rewards, recognition, or fear of loss\"] D --\u003e D2[\"Focuses on external validation\"] D --\u003e D3[\"⚠️ Leader action: Reconnect to purpose, shift focus from reward to meaning\"] E --\u003e E1[\"Low interest or energy\"] E --\u003e E2[\"‘Just doing the job’ attitude\"] E --\u003e E3[\"🚑 Leader action: Re-engage through ownership, connect work to personal impact\"] F --\u003e F1[\"Motivated mainly by fear or pressure\"] F --\u003e F2[\"Delivers short-term results, risks burnout\"] F --\u003e F3[\"💬 Leader action: Reduce pressure, build psychological safety and trust\"] Identify task type \u0026 response strategy This helps to decide if we should use incentives, autonomy, or structure depending on the task’s nature.\nDifferent kinds of work need different motivational strategies. For routine or operational work, structure and even small incentives can help. But for creative or problem-solving tasks - like most software work - autonomy and meaning drive performance more effectively.\nflowchart TD A[\"Task identified\"] --\u003e B{\"Type of work?\"} B --\u003e|Routine / Repetitive| C[\"Clearly defined steps \u0026 outcome\"] B --\u003e|Creative / Problem-Solving| D[\"Unclear path, requires insight\"] C --\u003e E[\"Focus on consistency \u0026 quality\"] C --\u003e F[\"OK to use clear metrics or small rewards\"] D --\u003e G[\"Focus on autonomy \u0026 exploration\"] D --\u003e H[\"Avoid controlling rewards\"] E --\u003e I[\"Support mastery via feedback loops\"] G --\u003e J[\"Provide purpose \u0026 trust\"] Risks of defining the wrong goals A clear, cautionary slide that ties everything back to leadership mistakes that kill motivation.\nMisaligned metrics Rewarding the number of commits instead of value delivered drives wrong behavior.\nOutput over Outcome People optimize for what’s measured - not necessarily what matters.\nShort-term focus Bonuses or targets can create tunnel vision and reduce learning or collaboration.\nCrowding out intrinsic motivation Overemphasis on KPIs or rewards signals: “We don’t trust your internal drive”.\nCulture impact When goals reward competition, not collaboration - trust and creativity drop.\nAs a leaders, we have to define goals that connect to purpose, support autonomy, and nurture mastery, rather than simply counting outputs.\n7. Closing \u0026 Reflection (5–10 min) Return to the title: “Why You Should NOT Motivate People?”\nWrap-up line:\n“Our role is not to motivate - it’s to create the conditions where motivation can thrive. People don’t need us to light a fire under them. They need us to stop pouring water on the fire they already have.”\nFinal question:\n“What will you stop doing that kills motivation?” “What will you start doing to let intrinsic motivation breathe?” My slide decks And PDF version here .\nEnjoyed this post? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs external link ↩︎\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory external link ↩︎\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation_crowding_theory external link ↩︎\nhttps://selfdeterminationtheory.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1999_DeciKoestnerRyan_Meta.pdf external link ↩︎\n","wordCount":"1398","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://gagor.pro/2025/09/why-you-should-not-motivate-people/images/cover.webp","datePublished":"2025-09-26T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2026-01-05T20:24:09+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tom"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gagor.pro/2025/09/why-you-should-not-motivate-people/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tom's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gagor.pro/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gagor.pro/ accesskey=h title="Tom's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gagor.pro/favicon-36x36.avif alt="Page logo" aria-label=logo height=36 width=36>Tom's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
