Most people heard about Murphy’s Law, but there are many more that can be useful in corporate reality 😉\nI will introduce my favorites in this post.\nKidlin’s Law Kidlin’s Law states,\n“If you can write the problem down clearly, then the matter is half solved.”\nThis law emphasizes the power of clear communication and problem definition. Often, the first step in solving any problem is to articulate it well. By writing down the problem, we can analyze it more effectively, identify the root causes, and brainstorm potential solutions.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nClarity in Objectives: Ensure that goals and problems are clearly documented in projects and tasks. Brainstorming Sessions: Encourage teams to write down issues before discussing them to foster structured thinking. Documentation: Maintain detailed records of problems and solutions for future reference. Gilbert’s Law Gilbert’s Law states,\n“The biggest problem at work is that nobody tells you what to do.”\nThis law underscores the importance of clear guidance and communication from leadership. In the absence of clear instructions, employees may feel lost, leading to inefficiency and frustration.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nClear Instructions: Managers should provide clear, concise instructions and expectations. Regular Check-Ins: Frequent meetings to ensure everyone understands their roles and responsibilities. Feedback Mechanisms: Create channels for employees to seek clarification and provide feedback. Wilson’s Law Wilson’s Law posits,\n“A good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow.”\nThis law highlights the value of timely action over delayed perfection. Waiting for a flawless plan can lead to missed opportunities and stagnation. It advocates for making the best possible decision with the information at hand and adjusting as needed.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nAgile Methodology: Implement iterative development and decision-making processes. Encourage Proactivity: Empower employees to take action and make decisions without fear of perfection. Review and Adapt: Regularly review plans and outcomes to make necessary adjustments. Falkland’s Law Falkland’s Law states,\n“When it is not necessary to make a decision, it is necessary not to make a decision.”\nThis law advises against making unnecessary decisions. Sometimes, the best course of action is to wait until more information is available or until the situation becomes clearer. Premature decisions can lead to unnecessary complications and stress.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nAssess Urgency: Determine whether a decision needs to be made immediately or if it can wait. Gather Information: Ensure all relevant data is available before making decisions. Avoid Overcommitment: Recognize when it’s appropriate to delay decisions to prevent rash actions. Murphy’s Law Murphy’s Law famously states1,\n“Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.”\nThis law humorously encapsulates the inevitability of errors and unforeseen problems in any situation. It serves as a reminder to prepare for the worst-case scenario and maintain flexibility and resilience.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nRisk Management: Identify potential risks and develop contingency plans. Prepare for Failures: Ensure backup systems and processes are in place. Maintain Flexibility: Be ready to adapt and respond to unexpected issues promptly. Conway’s Law Conway’s Law states2,\n“Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”\nThis law, formulated by Melvin Conway in 1967, suggests that the architecture of products and systems inevitably reflects the communication patterns and structure of the organization that creates them. In other words, if teams are divided in a certain way, the systems they build will mirror those divisions.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nOrganizational Design: Align team structures with desired system architecture to avoid unnecessary complexity. Cross-Team Collaboration: Foster communication across teams to encourage more integrated and cohesive system designs. System Refactoring: When reorganizing teams, review system architecture for potential improvements or simplifications. Metcalfe’s Law Metcalfe’s Law states3,\n“The value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its connected users.”\nProposed by Robert Metcalfe, this law highlights how the usefulness or value of a network (such as a social network or communication platform) increases dramatically as more users join. Each additional participant increases the number of possible connections, making the network exponentially more valuable.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nTeam Size Management: Recognize that as team size grows, the number of communication channels increases rapidly (for n people, there are n(n-1)/2 connections). When teams exceed 10–12 members, coordination and leadership become significantly more complex. To maintain efficiency and clarity, consider splitting large teams into smaller, more manageable groups. Network Effects: Encourage user growth to maximize the value of platforms and communities. Collaboration Tools: Promote adoption of shared tools to enhance communication and collaboration. Ecosystem Building: Foster partnerships and integrations to expand the reach and utility of products. Parkinson’s Law Parkinson’s Law states4,\n“Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”\nFirst articulated by Cyril Northcote Parkinson in 1955, this law observes that tasks often take as much time as you allow for them, regardless of their actual complexity. When more time is allocated than necessary, work tends to become unnecessarily complex or drawn out, leading to inefficiency and procrastination.\nNote\nPractical Application:\nSet Clear Deadlines: Assign realistic but firm deadlines to prevent tasks from dragging on. Timeboxing: Use timeboxing techniques to limit the amount of time spent on specific activities. Prioritization: Focus on delivering value quickly by breaking work into smaller, manageable pieces with short timelines. Avoid Overplanning: Resist the temptation to stretch simple tasks over long periods; encourage a results-oriented culture. Are these laws scientifically proven? These laws are largely anecdotal and based on observational wisdom rather than scientific rigor. They capture common experiences and insights in a memorable way but are not grounded in empirical research. Their value lies in their ability to highlight practical truths and guide behavior rather than in scientific validation.\n🟠 Kidlin’s Law: While not scientifically proven, it aligns with cognitive and psychological theories suggesting that problem definition is crucial for problem-solving. 🟢 Gilbert’s Law: Supported by management studies emphasizing the need for clear communication and guidance in organizations. 🟢 Wilson’s Law: Reflects principles found in agile methodologies and decision-making theories that favor timely action. 🟠 Falkland’s Law: Resonates with decision-making strategies that advise against premature decisions without sufficient information. 🔴 Murphy’s Law: More of a humorous axiom than a scientific principle, it underscores the importance of risk management. 🟢 Conway’s Law: Supported by empirical observations in software engineering and organizational studies, it highlights the impact of organizational structure on system design. 🟠 Metcalfe’s Law: Widely referenced in network theory and economics, it is supported by observations of network growth and value, though the exact proportionality is debated. 🟢 Parkinson’s Law: Supported by studies in behavioral economics and organizational psychology, it is widely observed in real-world work environments, though often cited as an empirical rule rather than a strict scientific law. Conclusion Some of those laws have serious, scientific background and can be used to strengthen your position in discussion, as it would be unreasonable to “doubt the science”. Other can be a soft joke, allowing to swiftly escape from unconvenient situation:\nWhy this deployment failed? Because it could… You know, Murphy’s Law… Having them prepared in your pocket, you can throw “Aces” at will supporting your decisions 😉\nEnjoyed? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law external link ↩︎\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law external link ↩︎\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law external link ↩︎\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law external link ↩︎\n","wordCount":"1223","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://gagor.pro/2025/08/laws-for-every-occasion/images/cover.webp","datePublished":"2025-08-26T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-11-16T11:12:25+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tom"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gagor.pro/2025/08/laws-for-every-occasion/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tom's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gagor.pro/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gagor.pro/ accesskey=h title="Tom's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gagor.pro/favicon-36x36.avif alt="Page logo" aria-label=logo height=36 width=36>Tom's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">
