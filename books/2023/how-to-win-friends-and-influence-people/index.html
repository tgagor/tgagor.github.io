However, it‚Äôs worth considering certain mistakes that make it difficult for us to interact with people, such as when we talk too much and don‚Äôt let others get a word in.\nEither way, I think the book is about manipulation. Yes, if we apply the principles sincerely, it can improve interactions in specific situations. However, if we start using certain techniques automatically, we may influence others ‚Äúmore intensely‚Äù than before, as if bypassing their firewall üòÑ\nRegardless, it was an enjoyable read, so I took the liberty of jotting down the rules to occasionally glance at and remind myself üôÇ\nBasic Principles in Human Relations Don‚Äôt criticize, condemn, or complain.\nInstead of condemning people, let‚Äôs try to understand them. Let‚Äôs think about why they do what they do. It‚Äôs more beneficial, it breeds sympathy, tolerance, and kindness.\nGive honest and sincere appreciation.\nStop thinking about your own accomplishments and wishes. Try to see the virtues of the other person. Forget flattery, give honest and sincere appreciation.\nArouse in others an eager want.\nWhen we come up with a great idea, instead of emphasizing at every turn that it‚Äôs ours, let‚Äôs try to let others consider it their own. They will like it more and perhaps even take a few servings.\nSix Ways to Make People Like You Show genuine interest in others.\n‚ÄúWe are interested in others when they are interested in us.‚Äù Showing interest must be sincere. It must benefit not only the person showing interest but also the one who is its object. It works both ways, and both parties benefit.\nSmile.\n‚ÄúA person who doesn‚Äôt smile shouldn‚Äôt open a shop.‚Äù Your smile is a messenger of your good will. Your smile brightens the lives of all who see it. For someone who sees dozens of gloomy and cloudy faces averting their eyes, your smile is a ray of sunshine breaking through the clouds. Especially when that person is being harassed by their boss, customers, teachers, parents, or children, your smile reminds them that not everything is hopeless, that there is still joy in the world.\nRemember that a person‚Äôs name is to them the sweetest and most important sound in any language.\nWe should realize the importance of names and always remember that they are sacred and exclusive property of the person we are talking to. No one else‚Äôs! A name distinguishes an individual from others, making them unique among all people. The information we provide or the request we make takes on special significance if we add the name of our interlocutor. From the waitress to the president - a remembered name works wonders in our interactions with them.\nBe a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.\nIf you want to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. Show interest in others, and you will seem interesting to them. Ask questions that the interlocutor will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments. Remember that the people you talk to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their problems than in you and the matters that concern you.\nTalk in terms of the other person‚Äôs interests.\nTalking to people in terms of what interests them rather than what interests us benefits both parties.\nMake the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.\n‚ÄúTalk to people about themselves, and they will listen for hours.‚Äù\nHow to Win People to Your Way of Thinking The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.\nWelcome the disagreement. Control your temper. Listen first. Look for areas of agreement. Be honest. Promise to think over your opponent‚Äôs ideas and study them carefully. Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. Show respect for the other person‚Äôs opinions. Never say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong.‚Äù\nIn other words, don‚Äôt argue with your customer, spouse, or adversary. Don‚Äôt tell them they‚Äôre wrong; don‚Äôt make them defensive. Use a bit of diplomacy.\nIf you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.\nConsider also that I don‚Äôt fully agree with everything. Not everything I wrote yesterday speaks to me with the same force‚Ä¶\nBegin in a friendly way.\nThe sun can make you take off your coat faster than the wind. And kindliness, a friendly approach, and appreciation can induce people to change their minds faster than all the storms and tempests in the world.\nGet the other person saying ‚Äúyes, yes‚Äù immediately.\n‚Ä¶ He asked questions to which his interlocutor had to answer in the affirmative. And he gathered affirmative responses one after another, until he had a whole mountain of agreements behind him. He asked questions so persistently that his opponent, without realizing it, came to conclusions he would have vehemently protested against just a few minutes earlier.\nLet the other person do a great deal of the talking.\nEven friends prefer to tell us about their achievements rather than listen to us bragging about our own.\nLet the other person feel that the idea is theirs.\nTry honestly to see things from the other person‚Äôs point of view.\nIf reading this book achieves nothing else but making you always try to see things from the other person‚Äôs point of view‚Ä¶ you will quickly find it to be a turning point‚Ä¶\nBe sympathetic with the other person‚Äôs ideas and desires.\n‚ÄúAll of humanity craves sympathy and understanding.‚Äù\nAppeal to the nobler motives.\n‚Ä¶ People are honest and want to live up to their obligations‚Ä¶ even those who want to take us for a ride will, in most cases, react honestly if we let them know we consider them honest, decent, and upright.\nDramatize your ideas. It‚Äôs not just the facts, but the way they are presented that matters.\nThrow down a challenge. This is what every successful person loves: the gamble. The chance to show their worth. The chance to prove themselves, to compete, and to win.\nBe a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment Begin with praise and honest appreciation.\nCall attention to people‚Äôs mistakes indirectly.\nSuggest alternative usage, propose looking in the mirror, and making decisions independently.\nTalk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.\nAsk questions instead of giving direct orders.\nLet the other person save face.\nIt‚Äôs not what I think of him that matters, but what he thinks of himself.\nPraise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be ‚Äúhearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.‚Äù\nGive the other person a fine reputation to live up to.\nUse encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.\nMake the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.\nShow the benefits of the task for the performer to reduce their resistance.\n","wordCount":"1183","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://gagor.pro/images/book-cover.webp","datePublished":"2023-12-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-05-27T07:07:41+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"timor"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gagor.pro/books/2023/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tom's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gagor.pro/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gagor.pro/ accesskey=h title="Tom's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://gagor.pro/favicon-36x36.avif alt="Page logo" aria-label=logo height=36 width=36>Tom's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gagor.pro/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gagor.pro/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gagor.pro/bookshelf/ title=Bookshelf><span>Bookshelf</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gagor.pro/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://gagor.pro/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gagor.pro/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://gagor.pro/books/>Books</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">How to Win Friends & Influence People</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-12-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>2023-12-14</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;timor</div></header><div class=post-content><figure style=display:flex><img loading=lazy src=images/book-cover.webp width=220><figcaption style=margin-left:1em;float:right><q>How to Win Friends & Influence People</q><p>Author: Carnegie Dale</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034?tag=gagor-21&amp;utm_campaign=affiliate_sale&amp;utm_id=affiliate_sale&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=www.amazon.com" target=_blank>amazon.com</a></li><li><a href=https://www.empik.com/jak-zdobyc-przyjaciol-i-zjednac-sobie-ludzi-carnegie-dale,p1294517113,ksiazka-p target=_blank>empik.com</a></li></ul></figcaption></figure><p>The book is written in a typical American style - &ldquo;do this and that, and your life will change forever&mldr;&rdquo; &#x1f604;</p><p>Applying the book&rsquo;s rules too bluntly may come off as manipulative, and our conversation partner will sense it.
