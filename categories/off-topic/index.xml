I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Wordpress as an engine of my blog for past 8~9 years. I have small VPS with PHP + Nginx and you can find a lot of configuration examples from my config on this site ðŸ˜„
There was a time, when I was really satisfied by what it provides.</description></item><item><title>Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 for Desktop on Linux</title><link>https://timor.site/2016/02/intel-dual-band-wireless-ac-7260-for-desktop-on-linux/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timor.site/2016/02/intel-dual-band-wireless-ac-7260-for-desktop-on-linux/</guid><description>I just bought new wifi card for my desktop computer.

I was reviewing my favorites/bookmarks and half of them was broken, so I can&amp;rsquo;t rely on them in case of knowledge management.
I think I will write shorter, less descriptive articles just to be pointers to useful solutions from past.</description></item><item><title>Changing language of articles on my blog to English</title><link>https://timor.site/2013/11/changing-language-of-articles-on-my-blog-to-english/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timor.site/2013/11/changing-language-of-articles-on-my-blog-to-english/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve crated this blog to get feedback from other IT guys about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing wrong (or not good enough). But this idea failed&amp;hellip;
I have only few comments on my blog (and about thousand and a half spams per month) - so, no feedback in my national language at all.
Switching to English should make my audience bigger and I hope to have more attention thanks to that. This will be also a good practice of my English skill.</description></item><item><title>Spammer screwed up</title><link>https://timor.site/2013/09/spammer-screwed-up/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://timor.site/2013/09/spammer-screwed-up/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just received a comment on my blog with text attached below.
