For redundancy, in case of disk failure. I started with some crazy LVM mirrors done on two disks of different size. Sync job was starting on every boot 😄\nThen came time for RAID5 on mdadm + LVM for volume management. It was working nice until the moment when disks became bigger. Long array rebuilds or checks, required my PC to stay turned on overnight just to validate if stuff works still.\nThen in work, I had my first contact with ZFS and it was love at first sight ❤️ Biggest improvement was, that after creation of pool there’s no need to re-sync whole disk. Both resilvering or scrub were much faster than standard mdadm check.\nMy old disks are 2TB big and almost each of them is different now. I started with 3 x ST2000DL003 2TB, but after failure of one I was unable to buy exact replacement. Closest possible was: ST2000DM001. Since that moment, I had disks running at variable speed around 5400RPM and one on 7200RPM. I decided to add another drive to the pool as spare, it was Samsung HD204UI. After it failed, I added WDC Black WD2003FYYS 2TB.\nToday, oldest disk is around 10 years old, youngest are around 8. Just this is pretty awful but what pushed me to replace them, was actual lack of space 😄\nI was hoping to find 4 x 8TB drives which will quadruple my capacity and should provide enough space and safety for years to come, but I couldn’t find any reasonably priced offers. I even bought 4 x Toshiba X300 8TB. I started copying data to them… And they started dying one by one 😞 Actually, they didn’t die, but SMART was reporting “pre-fail” condition, when they were working heavily for too long. What if I have to re-sync/scrub whole pool? Will they die in the middle. I returned all of them. It was first time I gave a chance to Toshiba. It was last time 😉\nThen I saw a movie on Youtube or article - someone was buying at bulk cheap external HDDs and “shucking” them 1. It was pretty close to how I understand building RAID as “Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks” 😉 Those disk are usually pretty good disks - either WD RED which are actually designed for NAS/RAID workload, or so called “white labels” which are just variations of HGST drives (sometimes slower, with less cache, etc).\nI noticed a promo on Amazon on WD Elements 14TB and I bought 3 of them. Wanted 4, but they were limiting orders. They were 30% cheaper than similar internal HDDs.\nWhat’s inside? I connected them as they’re provided, in those plastic coffins and started playing. First I stress tested them with badblocks 2 3.\nRun badblocks badblocks -b 4096 -wsv /dev/sde After around 1 hour, all of them were quite warm. Having between 53~55°C. Theoretically those drives can operate in up to 60°C, but at the end of 2nd day, two disk turned off and I have to turn them off and on again to make them discoverable, which just reminds me:\nAs SMART didn’t notice anything worrying, I was quite sure it’s just because of temperature (coldest one stayed alive). I finished my torture testing here and decided to “shuck” them.\nThere’s really good instruction on how to do that on iFixit 4, so I won’t be explaining it here.\nI ended up having 3 new WDC WD140EDGZ-11B1PA0 14TB 5400RPM disks, with average transfers around 170~200MB/s. What’s interesting SMART recognise them as 7200RPM, but I heard it’s not worth to trust it in case of WDC/HGST drives.\nsmartctl output smartctl 7.2 2020-12-30 r5155 [x86_64-linux-5.13.0-21-generic] (local build) Copyright (C) 2002-20, Bruce Allen, Christian Franke, www.smartmontools.org === START OF INFORMATION SECTION === Device Model: WDC WD140EDGZ-11B1PA0 LU WWN Device Id: 5 000cca 2adcc7fcb Firmware Version: 85.00A85 User Capacity: 14 000 519 643 136 bytes [14,0 TB] Sector Sizes: 512 bytes logical, 4096 bytes physical Rotation Rate: 7200 rpm Form Factor: 3.5 inches Device is: Not in smartctl database [for details use: -P showall] ATA Version is: ACS-2, ATA8-ACS T13/1699-D revision 4 SATA Version is: SATA 3.2, 6.0 Gb/s (current: 6.0 Gb/s) Local Time is: Fri Nov 12 15:59:23 2021 CET SMART support is: Available - device has SMART capability.
