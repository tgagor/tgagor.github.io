Author: Jacek Dukaj
amazon.plamazon.comempik.com Starość Aksolotla is a book written by Polish author Jacek Dukaj that I recently had the pleasure of reading. The book is a science fiction novel that explores themes of longevity, immortality, and the meaning of life. The protagonist of the story is a centuries-old axolotl, a species of salamander that is capable of regenerating its limbs and organs, who embarks on a journey of self-discovery as he grapples with the consequences of his own immortality.</description>

      <description>The three-body problemAuthor: Cixin Liu
amazon.plamazon.comempik.comhelion.pl The novel is set in the future and follows the discovery of an alien civilization, the Trisolarans, and humanity&amp;rsquo;s attempts to make contact and defend against them. The book is known for its complex scientific concepts, philosophical ideas, and intricate storyline.
Overall, &amp;ldquo;The Three-Body Problem&amp;rdquo; has been highly praised by readers and critics for its unique and thought-provoking approach to science fiction.
Personally, I found this book to be annoying in a few places, especially when it referred to people&amp;rsquo;s commitment following government decisions.</description>
