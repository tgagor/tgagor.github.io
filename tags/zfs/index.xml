      <description>What I want to do? I use my pool to securely store backups, archive my old documents and keep huge family&amp;rsquo;s photo library.
I have new disks. They were tortured with badblocks , so they&amp;rsquo;re ready to create ZFS pool.
I&amp;rsquo;ve read few documents about different approaches 1 2 3. I wanted to be sure if anything changed during past years. One of articles recommends mirroring over RAIDZ. Resilvering is faster, at the same time putting IO less stress on whole pool.</description>

      <description>I used to have RAID (or at least some variation of it) for my main storage. For redundancy, in case of disk failure. I started with some crazy LVM mirrors done on two disks of different size. Sync job was starting on every boot &amp;#x1f604;
Then came time for RAID5 on mdadm + LVM for volume management. It was working nice until the moment when disks became bigger. Long array rebuilds or checks, required my PC to stay turned on overnight just to validate if stuff works still.</description>
