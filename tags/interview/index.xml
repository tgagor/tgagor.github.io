      <description>A little bit of sour-sweet memories I&amp;rsquo;ve been in many job interviews. Few as a candidate but many more as a Technical Leader or Hiring Manager. There are many questions I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked and many tests I passed. I remember one test, where I had to install and configure Apache Tomcat on a Virtual Machine, under Windows (which I don&amp;rsquo;t use for years), without access to internet. There were more traps there, like some files in the locations where Tomcat is normally installed were blocked for write with chattr immutable attribute.</description>
