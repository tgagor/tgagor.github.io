      <description>IMO people don&amp;rsquo;t understand how VOLUME1 works so they don&amp;rsquo;t use it. It&amp;rsquo;s generally used far too rarely!
In short VOLUME means two things:
Whatever is left in directory marked as VOLUME, stays there and can&amp;rsquo;t be changed in later layers (actually it can be changed but changes won&amp;rsquo;t be persistent). Volumes are not part of layered image FS. They&amp;rsquo;re mounted as anonymous volumes located on standard file system. This means they&amp;rsquo;re working much faster.</description>

      <description>People often complain, that building Docker image takes a long time. &amp;ldquo;I just added a single jar package&amp;rdquo; they say&amp;hellip; Really?
They often don&amp;rsquo;t remember that whole &amp;ldquo;build context&amp;rdquo;1 is uploaded to Docker daemon during build, which often means they&amp;rsquo;re not only adding &amp;ldquo;single jar&amp;rdquo;, but also all sources, test results and whatever they have in working directory.
Solution is simple - to use .dockerignore file2. Syntax is similar to .</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking for a long time about writing set of articles on the topic of: &amp;ldquo;Dockerfile writing best practices&amp;rdquo;.
As it&amp;rsquo;s often my daily job to prepare best in class containers, that are later used by thousands of company&amp;rsquo;s applications, I have quite good insights on the topic. Some experience and knowledge gathered is often against intuition and building it took me a while. I want to share it, with a hope that feedback I get will allow me to excel on the topic even further.</description>
