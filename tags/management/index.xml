Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us is a book that I recently read and found to be highly insightful. The author, Daniel H.

He claims that in today&amp;rsquo;s rapidly changing and complex world, autonomy, mastery, and purpose are the most important drivers of motivation.
I was impressed by Pink&amp;rsquo;s research and the range of real-world examples he uses to support his arguments.</description>
