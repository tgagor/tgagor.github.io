Malware scans whole network for easy SSH access and when find something will try some brute force attacks, overloading such machines. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to have one exposed, but secured host, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t host anything and is used as proxy/gateway to access our infrastructure- it&amp;rsquo;s called bastion host.
Ansible is quite easy to integrate with bastion host configuration.</description></item></channel></rss>
