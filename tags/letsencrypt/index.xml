But the more I read how they want to implement it, the more I dislike it.
Current project with automatic configuration is not what I want to use at all. I have many very complicated configs and I do not trust such tools enough to use them. I like UNIX&amp;rsquo;s single purpose principle, tools should do one thing and do it well - nothing more.</description></item></channel></rss>
