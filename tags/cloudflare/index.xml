      <description>I used to utilize GitHub Pages to serve static content for my blog. I secured it behind Cloudflare to employ a custom domain and automate HTTPS certificate management. Additionally, I utilized a few Page Rules to implement redirects:
From www.* to non-www, From HTTP to HTTPS, And for some SEO renaming. Unfortunately, in the Free plan from Cloudflare, you are limited to:
3 Page Rules (with simple glob matching), 10 Transformation Rules (no regex rules), 10 Redirect Rules (no regex).</description>

      <description>Info
I use free tier of Cloudflare and all recommendations assume only those are available.
Why to cache statically generated blog? My Blog is statically generated website served from Github Pages&amp;thinsp; external link . As Github don&amp;rsquo;t allow to easily set my own domain (at least in free version), I needed some kind of proxy that:
can serve page from my domain, will provide valid certificate for HTTPS. Info</description>

      <description>I watched nice presentation about how Cloudflare protects itself against DoS. Most of us are not able to do that exactly like them but some of tips were general enough to be used on typical web front server.
I took notes from this presentation and presented here. Thanks to Marek agreement I also reposted all examples (in easier to copy paste way).
