      <title>Adding Mermaid diagrams to Hugo</title>

      <description>I used Chart.js charts on one of my Hugo blogs for few years already. Recently I needed to add few diagrams and I started glueing them in Chart.js but then I found that Hugo supports GoAT and Mermaid diagrams. They&amp;rsquo;re not working out of the box, but it&amp;rsquo;s easy to extend. Much easier than my custom shortcodes.
I tried to follow up the instruction1 but failed. After few minutes I found slightly simpler solution.</description>

      <title>Changing comments provider for my blog</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about switching comments system to something different on my blog. Since I moved to Hugo, I used Disqus. Integration was easy and it was also easy to move comments from Wordpress. Maybe the move was easy, but people somehow didn&amp;rsquo;t like the interface. I receive 6 comments since I switched from Wordpress 3 years ago &amp;#x1f604; To be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t like it too.
I was thinking about switch to something else, something different, but I was waiting for this punch.</description>

      <title>Bye Bye Wordpress!</title>

      <description>I started my blog on custom (written by my) engine, but as I didn&amp;rsquo;t had enough time to enhance it I switched to Wordpress. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Wordpress as an engine of my blog for past 8~9 years. I have small VPS with PHP + Nginx and you can find a lot of configuration examples from my config on this site &amp;#x1f604;
There was a time, when I was really satisfied by what it provides.</description>
