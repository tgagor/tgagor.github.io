      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about switching comments system to something different on my blog. Since I moved to Hugo, I used Disqus. Integration was easy and it was also easy to move comments from Wordpress. Maybe the move was easy, but people somehow don&amp;rsquo;t like the interface. It&amp;rsquo;s bloated and to be honest, when I see comments with Disqus - I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to share anything&amp;hellip;
Looks like people think the same, because I receive 6 comments since I switched from Wordpress 3 years ago ðŸ˜„ I was thinking about switch to something else, something different, but I was waiting for this punch, until Disqus went to far and started showing adds on my page!</description>

      <description>I started my blog on custom (written by my) engine, but as I didn&amp;rsquo;t had enough time to enhance it I switched to Wordpress. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Wordpress as an engine of my blog for past 8~9 years. I have small VPS with PHP + Nginx and you can find a lot of configuration examples from my config on this site ðŸ˜„
There was a time, when I was really satisfied by what it provides.</description>
