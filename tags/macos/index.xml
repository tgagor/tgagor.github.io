      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how it is in your company, but in mine it&amp;rsquo;s considered a good practice to add ticket numbers to commit messages. It allows to easily determine why something was changed, etc. Makes sense, but this also means, that I should be adding this ticket to every message&amp;hellip; And this doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense for me. I will accidentally avoid it from time to time or make a lot of typos.</description>

      <description>I was updating my blog and needed to generate few variants of images, in different resolution.
Option 1 - sips There&amp;rsquo;s simple, builtin tool sips, that can be used for simple resizing 1:
Resize single image sips -Z 36 orig.png --out static/favicon36x36.png -Z - maintain image aspect ratio 36 - maximum height and width It can be also used for batch image processing:
Warning
Beware, without &amp;ndash;out param, it will overwrite images in place!</description>

      <title>Homebrew - uninstall formula with dependencies</title>

      <description>I use brew extensively on MacOS. It&amp;rsquo;s just as convenient as many Linux package managers. What I don&amp;rsquo;t like, it leaves dependencies after removal of formula. There&amp;rsquo;s simple way to clean it up by running one command 1.
Uninstall with dependencies brew uninstall FORMULA brew autoremove Info
In my case running brew autoremove actually removed few packages I really wanted to have. Check the output carefully!

      <title>Moving from Linux to MacOS â€“ first steps</title>
      <link>https://timor.site/2020/01/moving-from-linux-to-macos-first-steps/</link>

      <description>Few years ago I moved from Linux desktop to MacOS for my business, day to day work. There were 2 main reasons for that:
Corporations don&amp;rsquo;t like Linux - they can&amp;rsquo;t manage it, they can&amp;rsquo;t support it, so they blocked it with &amp;ldquo;Security policy&amp;rdquo;, ISO20001, or other nonsense. Actually they&amp;rsquo;re partially right but in different place - many business collaboration applications don&amp;rsquo;t work well on LInux (or they don&amp;rsquo;t work at all) Skype for Business - there&amp;rsquo;s open source alternative but to get full support you have to pay for additional codecs (as far as I remember) - it&amp;rsquo;s not working stable even in paid version Outlook and calendar support - I love Thunderbird and I use it for years, but calendar invitations didn&amp;rsquo;t work nice (honestly, they didn&amp;rsquo;t work nice even between different Outlook versions&amp;hellip;) Corporate VPN apps - Christ, I always was able to get it working eventually, but&amp;hellip; why bother I&amp;rsquo;m older, maybe lazier, maybe smarter - I don&amp;rsquo;t like to spend my time resolving problems that don&amp;rsquo;t give me any value.</description>
